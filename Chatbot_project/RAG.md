CHAPTER X

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES

A. INTRODUCTION

In the following pages I shall attempt a general description of the types, and my first concern
must be with the two general types I have termed introverted and extraverted. But, in addition, I
shall also try to give a certain characterization of those special types whose particularity is due to
the fact that his most differentiated function plays the principal role in an individual's adaptation
or orientation to life. The former I would term general attitude types, since they are distinguished
by the direction of general interest or libido movement, while the latter I would call function-
types.

The general-attitude types, as I have pointed out more than once, are differentiated by their
particular attitude to the object. The introvert's attitude to the object is an abstracting one; at
bottom, he is always facing the problem of how libido can be withdrawn from the object, as
though an attempted ascendancy on. the part of the object had to be continually frustrated. The
extravert, on the contrary, maintains a positive relation to the object. To such an extent does he
affirm its importance that his subjective attitude is continually being orientated by, and related to
the object. An fond, the object can never have sufficient value; for him, therefore, its importance
must always be paramount.

The two types are so essentially different, presenting so striking a contrast, that their existence,
even to the [p. 413] uninitiated in psychological matters becomes an obvious fact, when once
attention has been drawn to it. Who does not know those taciturn, impenetrable, often shy
natures, who form such a vivid contrast to these other open, sociable, serene maybe, or at least
friendly and accessible characters, who are on good terms with all the world, or, even when
disagreeing with it, still hold a relation to it by which they and it are mutually affected.

Naturally, at first, one is inclined to regard such differences as mere individual idiosyncrasies.
But anyone with the opportunity of gaining a fundamental knowledge of many men will soon
discover that such a far-reaching contrast does not merely concern the individual case, but is a
question of typical attitudes, with a universality far greater than a limited psychological
experience would at first assume. In reality, as the preceding chapters will have shown, it is a
question of a fundamental opposition; at times clear and at times obscure, but always emerging
whenever we are dealing with individuals whose personality is in any way pronounced. Such
men are found not only among the educated classes, but in every rank of society; with equal
distinctness, therefore, our types can be demonstrated among labourers and peasants as among

the most differentiated members of a nation. Furthermore, these types over-ride the distinctions
of sex, since one finds the same contrasts amongst women of all classes. Such a universal
distribution could hardly arise at the instigation of consciousness, ie. as the result of a conscious
and deliberate choice of attitude. If this were the case, a definite level of society, linked together
by a similar education and environment and, therefore, correspondingly localized, would surely
have a majority representation of such an attitude. But the actual facts are just the reverse, for the
types have, apparently, quite a random distribution. [p. 414] In the same family one child is
introverted, and another extraverted.

Since, in the light of these facts, the attitude-type regarded as a general phenomenon having an
apparent random distribution, can be no affair of conscious judgment or intention, its existence
must be due to some unconscious instinctive cause. The contrast of types, therefore, as a,
universal psychological. phenomenon, must in some way or other have its biological precursor.

The relation between subject and object, considered biologically, is always a relation of
adaptation, since every relation between subject and object presupposes mutually modifying
effects from either side. These modifications constitute the adaptation. The typical attitudes to
the object, therefore, are adaptation processes. Nature knows two fundamentally different ways
of adaptation, which determine the further existence of the living organism the one is by
increased fertility, accompanied by a relatively small degree of defensive power and individual
conservation; the other is by individual equipment of manifold means of self-protection, coupled
with a relatively insignificant fertility. This biological contrast seems not merely to be the
analogue, but also the general foundation of our two psychological modes of adaptation, At this
point a mere general indication must suffice; on the one hand, I need only point to the peculiarity
of the extravert, which constantly urges him to spend and propagate himself in every way, and,
on the other, to the tendency of the introvert to defend himself against external claims, to
conserve himself from any expenditure of energy directly related to the object, thus consolidating
for himself the most secure and impregnable position.

Blake's intuition did not err when he described the two forms as the "prolific" and the
"devouring" [1] As is [p. 415] shown by the general biological example, both forms are current
and successful after their kind ; this is equally true of the typical attitudes. What the one brings
about by a multiplicity of relations, the other gains by monopoly.

The fact that often in their earliest years children display an unmistakable typical attitude forces
us to assume that it cannot possibly be the struggle for existence, as it is generally understood,
which constitutes the compelling factor in favour of a definite attitude. We might, however,
demur, and indeed with cogency, that even the tiny infant, the very babe at the breast, has
already an unconscious psychological adaptation to perform, inasmuch as the special character of
the maternal influence leads to specific reactions in the child. This argument, though appealing to
incontestable facts, has none the less to yield before the equally unarguable fact that two children
of the same mother may at a very early age exhibit opposite types, without the smallest
accompanying change in the attitude of the mother. Although nothing would induce me to
underestimate the well-nigh incalculable importance of parental influence, this experience
compels me to conclude that the decisive factor must be looked for in the disposition of the child.
The fact that, in spite of the greatest possible similarity of external conditions, one child will

assume this type while another that, must, of course, in the last resort he ascribed to individual
disposition. Naturally in saying this I only refer to those cases which occur under normal
conditions. Under abnormal conditions, i.e. when there is an extreme and, therefore, abnormal
attitude in the mother, the children can also be coerced into a relatively similar attitude; but this
entails a violation of their individual disposition, which quite possibly would have assumed
another type if no abnormal and disturbing external influence had intervened. As a rule,
whenever such a falsification of type takes place as a result of external [p. 416] influence, the
individual becomes neurotic later, and a cur can successfully be sought only in a development of
that attitude which corresponds with the individual's natural way.

As regards the particular disposition, I know not what to say, except that there are clearly
individuals who have either a greater readiness and capacity for one way, or for whom it is more
congenial to adapt to that way rather than the other. In the last analysis it may well be that
physiological causes, inaccessible to our knowledge, play a part in this. That this may be the case
seems to me not improbable, in view of one's experience that a reversal of type often proves
exceedingly harmful to the physiological well-being of the organism, often provoking an acute
state of exhaustion.

B. The Extraverted Type

In our descriptions of this and the following type it will be necessary, in the interest of lucid and
comprehensive presentation, to discriminate between the conscious and unconscious psychology.
Let us first lend our minds to a description of the phenomena of consciousness.

(1)THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

Everyone is, admittedly, orientated by the data with which the outer world provides him ; yet we
see that this may be the case in a way that is only relatively decisive. Because it is cold out of
doors, one man is persuaded to wear his overcoat, another from a desire to become hardened
finds this unnecessary; one man admires the new tenor because all the world admires him,
another withholds his approbation not because he dislikes him but because in his view the
subject of general admiration is not thereby proved to be admirable; one submits to [p. 417] a
given state of affairs because his experience argues nothing else to be possible, another is
convinced that, although it has repeated itself a thousand times in the same way, the thousand
and first will be different. The former is orientated by the objective data; the latter reserves a
view, which is, as it were, interposed between himself and the objective fact. Now, when the
orientation to the object and to objective facts is so predominant that the most frequent and
essential decisions and actions are determined, not by subjective values but by objective
relations, one speaks of an extraverted attitude. When this is habitual, one speaks of an
extraverted type. If a man so thinks, feels, and acts, in a word so lives, as to correspond directly
with objective conditions and their claims, whether in a good sense or ill, he is extraverted. His
life makes it perfectly clear that it is the objective rather than the subjective value which plays
the greater role as the determining factor of his consciousness. He naturally has subjective
values, but their determining power has less importance than the external objective conditions.
Never, therefore, does he expect to find any absolute factors in his own inner life, since the only
ones he knows are outside himself. Epimetheus-like, his inner life succumbs to the external

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

5

necessity, not of course without a struggle; which, however, always ends in favour of the
objective determinant. His entire consciousness looks outwards to the world, because the
important and decisive determination always comes to him from without. But it comes to him
from without, only because that is where he expects it. All the distinguishing characteristics of
his psychology, in so far as they do not arise from the priority of one definite psychological
function or from individual peculiarities, have their origin in this basic attitude. Interest and
attention follow objective happenings and, primarily, those of the immediate environment. Not
[p. 418] only persons, but things, seize and rivet his interest. His actions, therefore, are also
governed by the influence of persons and things. They are directly related to objective data and
determinations, and are, as it were, exhaustively explainable on these grounds. Extraverted action
is recognizably related to objective conditions. In so far it is not purely reactive to environmental
stimuli, it character is constantly applicable to the actual circumstances, and it finds adequate and
appropriate play within the limits of the objective situation. It has no serious tendency to
transcend these bounds. The same holdsgood for interest: objective occurrences have a well-nigh
inexhaustible charm, so that in the normal course the extravert's interest makes no other claims.

The moral laws which govern his action coincide with the corresponding claims of society, i.e.
with the generally valid moral view-point. If the generally valid view were different, the
subjective moral guiding line would also be different, without the general psychological habitus
being in any way changed. It might almost seem, although it, is by no means the case, that this
rigid determination by objective factors would involve an altogether ideal and complete
adaptation to general conditions of life. An accommodation to objective data, such as we have
described, must, of course, seem a complete adaptation to the extraverted view, since from this
standpoint no other criterion exists. But from a higher point of view, it is by no means granted
that the standpoint of objectively given, facts is the normal one under all circumstances.
Objective conditions may be either temporarily or locally abnormal. An individual who is
accommodated to such con certainly conforms to the abnormal style of his surroundings, but, in
relation to the universally valid laws of life. He is, in common with his milieu, in an abnormal
position. The individual may, however, thrive in such surroundings [p. 419] but only to the point
when he, together with his whole milieu, is destroyed for transgressing the universal laws of life.
He must inevitably participate in this downfall with the same completeness as he was previously
adjusted to the objectively valid situation. He is adjusted, but not adapted, since adaptation
demands more than a mere frictionless participation in the momentary conditions of the
immediate environment. (Once more I would point to Spitteler's Epimetheus). Adaptation
demands an observance of laws far more universal in their application than purely local and
temporary conditions. Mere adjustment is the limitation of the normal extraverted type. On the
one hand, the extravert owes his normality to his ability to fit into existing conditions with
relative ease. He naturally pretends to nothing more than the satisfaction of existing objective
possibilities, applying himself, for instance, to the calling which offers sound prospective
possibilities in the actual situation in time and place. He tries to do or to make just what his
milieu momentarily needs and expects from him, and abstains from every innovation that is not
entirely obvious, or that in any way exceeds the expectation of those around him. But on the
other hand, his normality must also depend essentially upon whether the extravert takes into
account the actuality of his subjective needs and requirements; and this is just his weak point, for
the tendency of his type has such a strong outward direction that even the most obvious of all
subjective facts, namely the condition of his own body, may quite easily receive inadequate

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

consideration. The body is not sufficiently objective or 'external,' so that the satisfaction of
simple elementary requirements which are indispensable to physical well-being are no longer
given their place. The body accordingly suffers, to say nothing of the soul. Although, as a rule,
the extravert takes small note of [p. 420] this latter circumstance, his intimate domestic circle
perceives it all the more keenly. His loss of equilibrium is perceived by himself only when
abnormal bodily sensations make themselves felt.

These tangible facts he cannot ignore. It is natural he should regard them as concrete and
'objective', since for his mentality there exists only this and nothing more -- in himself. In others
he at once sees "imagination" at work. A too extraverted attitude may actually become so
regardless of the subject that the latter is entirely sacrificed to so-called objective claims; to the
demands, for instance, of a continually extending business, because orders lie claiming one's
attention or because profitable possibilities are constantly being opened up which must instantly
be seized.

This is the extravert's danger; he becomes caught up in objects, wholly losing himself in their
toils. The functional (nervous) or actual physical disorders which result from this state have a
compensatory significance, forcing the subject to an involuntary self-restriction. Should the
symptoms be functional, their peculiar formation may symbolically express the psychological
situation; a singer, for instance, whose fame quickly reaches a dangerous pitch tempting him to a
disproportionate outlay of energy, is suddenly robbed of his high tones by a nervous inhibition.
A man of very modest beginnings rapidly reaches a social position of great influence and wide
prospects, when suddenly he is overtaken by a psychogenic state, with all the symptoms of
mountain-sickness. Again, a man on the point of marrying an idolized woman of doubtful
character, whose value he extravagantly over-estimates, is seized with a spasm of the
oesophagus, which forces him to a regimen of two cups of milk in the day, demanding his three-
hourly attention. All visits to his fianceé are thus effectually stopped, and no choice is left to him
[p. 421] but to busy himself with his bodily nourishment. A man who through his own energy
and enterprise has built up a vast business, entailing an intolerable burden of work, is afflicted by
nervous attacks of thirst, as a result of which he speedily falls a victim to hysterical alcoholism.

Hysteria is, in my view, by far the most frequent neurosis with the extraverted type. The classical
example of hysteria is always characterized by an exaggerated rapport with the members of his
circle, and a frankly imitatory accommodation to surrounding conditions. A constant tendency to
appeal for interest and to produce impressions upon his milieu is a basic trait of the hysterical
nature. A correlate to this is his proverbial suggestibility, his pliability to another person's
influence. Unmistakable extraversion comes out in the communicativeness of the hysteric, which
occasionally leads to the divulging of purely phantastic contents; whence arises the reproach of
the hysterical lie.

To begin with, the 'hysterical' character is an exaggeration of the normal attitude; it is then
complicated by compensatory reactions from the side of the unconscious, which manifests its
opposition to the extravagant extraversion in the form of physical disorders, whereupon an
introversion of psychic energy becomes unavoidable. Through this reaction of the unconscious,
another category of symptoms arises which have a more introverted character. A morbid
intensification of phantasy activity belongs primarily to this category. From this general

characterization of the extraverted attitude, let us now turn to a description of the modifications,
which the basic psychological functions undergo as a result of this attitude. [p. 422]

(II) THE ATTITUDE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS

It may perhaps seem odd that I should speak of attitude of the 'unconscious'. As I have already
sufficiently indicated, I regard the relation of the unconscious to the conscious as compensatory.
The unconscious, according to this view, has as good a claim to an I attitude' as the conscious.

In the foregoing section I emphasized the tendency to a certain one-sidedness in the extraverted
attitude, due to the controlling power of the objective factor in the course, of psychic events. The
extraverted type is constantly tempted to give himself away (apparently) in favour of the object,
and to assimilate his subject to the object.  I have referred in detail to the ultimate consequences
of this exaggeration of the extraverted attitude, viz. to the injurious suppression of the subjective
factor. It is only, to be expected, therefore, that a psychic compensation of the conscious
extraverted attitude will lay especial weight upon the subjective factor, i.e. we shall have to
prove a strong egocentric tendency in the unconscious. Practical experience actually furnishes
this proof. I do not wish to enter into a casuistical survey at this point, so must refer my readers
to the ensuing sections, where I shall attempt to present the characteristic attitude of the
unconscious from the angle of each function-type, In this section we are merely concerned with
the compensation of a general extraverted attitude; I shall, therefore, confine myself to an equally
general characterization of the compensating attitude of the unconscious.

The attitude of the unconscious as an effective complement to the conscious extraverted attitude
has a definitely introverting character. It focusses libido upon the subjective factor, i.e. all those
needs and claims which are stifled or repressed by a too extraverted conscious [p. 423] attitude.
It may be readily gathered from what has been said in the previous section that a purely objective
orientation does violence to a multitude of subjective emotions, intentions, needs, and desires,
since it robs them of the energy which is their natural right. Man is not a machine that one can
reconstruct, as occasion demands, upon other lines and for quite other ends, in the hope that it
will then proceed to function, in a totally different way, just as normally as before. Man bears his
age-long history with him  in his very structure is written the history of mankind.

The historical factor represents a vital need, to which a wise economy must respond. Somehow
the past must become vocal, and participate in the present. Complete assimilation to the object,
therefore, encounters the protest of the suppressed minority, elements belonging to the past and
existing from the beginning. From this quite general consideration it may be understood why it is
that the unconscious claims of the extraverted type have an essentially primitive, infantile, and
egoistical character. When Freud says that the unconscious is "only able to wish", this
observation contains a large measure of truth for the unconscious of the extraverted type.
Adjustment and assimilation to objective data prevent inadequate subjective impulses from
reaching consciousness. These tendencies (thoughts, wishes, affects, needs, feelings, etc.) take on
a regressive character corresponding with the degree of their repression, ie. the less they are
recognized, the more infantile and archaic they become. The conscious attitude robs them of
their relatively disposable energycharge, only leaving them the energy of which it cannot deprive
them. This remainder, which still possesses a potency not to be under-estimated, can be

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

described only as primeval instinct. Instinct can never be rooted out from an individual by any
arbitrary measures; it requires [p. 424] the slow, organic transformation of many generations to
effect a radical change, for instinct is the energic [sic] expression of a definite organic
foundation.

Thus with every repressed tendency a considerable sum of energy ultimately remains. This sum
corresponds with the potency of the instinct and guards its effectiveness, notwithstanding the
deprivation of energy which made it unconscious. The measure of extraversion in the conscious
attitude entails a like degree of infantilism and archaism in the attitude of the unconscious. The
egoism which so often characterizes the extravert's unconscious attitude goes far beyond mere
childish selfishness; it even verges upon the wicked and brutal. It is here we find in fullest bloom
that incest-wish described by Freud. It is self-evident that these things are entirely unconscious,
remaining altogether hidden from the eyes of the uninitiated observer so long as the extraversion
of the conscious attitude does not reach an extreme stage. But wherever an exaggeration of the
conscious standpoint takes place, the unconscious also comes to light in a symptomatic form, i.e.
the unconscious egoism, infantilism, and archaism lose their original compensatory characters,
and appear in more or less open opposition to the conscious attitude. This process begins in the
form of an absurd exaggeration of the conscious standpoint, which is aimed at a further
repression of the unconscious, but usually ends in a reductio ad absurdum of the conscious
attitude, i.e. a collapse. The catastrophe may be an objective one, since the objective aims
gradually become falsified by the subjective. I remember the case of a printer who, starting as a
mere employé, worked his way up through two decades of hard struggle, till at last he was the
independent possessor of a very extensive business. The more the business extended, the more it
increased its hold upon him, until gradually every other interest [p. 425] was allowed to become
merged in it. At length he was completely enmeshed in its toils, and, as we shall soon see, this
surrender eventually proved his ruin. As a sort of compensation to his exclusive interest in the
business, certain memories of his childhood came to life. As a child he had taken great delight in
painting and drawing. But, instead of renewing this capacity for its own sake as a balancing side-
interest, he canalized it into his business and began to conceive 'artistic' elaborations of his
products. His phantasies unfortunately materialized: he actually began to produce after his own
primitive and infantile taste, with the result that after a very few years his business went to
pieces. He acted in obedience to one of our 'civilized ideals', which enjoins the energetic man to
concentrate everything upon the one end in view. But he went too far, and merely fell a victim to
the power of his subjective infantile claims.

But the catastrophic solution may also be subjective, i.e. in the form of a nervous collapse. Such
a solution always comes about as a result of the unconscious counterinfluence, which can
ultimately paralyse conscious action. In which case the claims of the unconscious force
themselves categorically upon consciousness, thus creating a calamitous cleavage which
generally reveals itself in two ways: either the subject no longer knows what he really wants and
nothing any longer interests him, or he wants too much at once and has too keen an interest-but
in impossible things. The suppression of infantile and primitive claims, which is often necessary
on "civilized" grounds, easily leads to neurosis, or to the misuse of narcotics such as alcohol,
morphine, cocaine, etc. In more extreme cases the cleavage ends in suicide.

It is a salient peculiarity of unconscious tendencies that, just in so far as they are deprived of
their energy by a lack of conscious recognition, they assume a correspond- [p. 426] ingly
destructive character, and as soon as this happen their compensatory function ceases. They cease
to have a compensatory effect as soon as they reach a depth or stratum that corresponds with a
level of culture absolutely incompatible with our own. From this moment the unconscious
tendencies form a block, which is opposed to the conscious attitude in every respect ; such a bloc
inevitably leads to open conflict.

In a general way, the compensating attitude of the unconscious finds expression in the process of
psychic equilibrium. A normal extraverted attitude does not, of course, mean that the individual
behaves invariably in accordance with the extraverted schema. Even in the same individual many
psychological happenings may be observed, in which the mechanism of introversion is
concerned. A habitus can be called extraverted only when the mechanism of extraversion
predominates. In such a case the most highly differentiated function has a constantly extraverted
application, while the inferior functions are found in the service of introversion, i.e. the more
valued function, because the more conscious, is more completely subordinated to conscious
control and purpose, whilst the less conscious, in other words, the partly unconscious inferior
functions are subjected to conscious free choice in a much smaller degree.

The superior function is always the expression of the conscious personality, its aim, its will, and
its achievement, whilst the inferior functions belong to the things that happen to one. Not that
they merely beget blunders, e.g. lapsus linguae or lapsus calami, but they may also breed half or
three-quarter resolves, since the inferior functions also possess a slight degree of consciousness.
The extraverted feeling type is a classical example of this, for he enjoys an excellent feeling
rapport with his entourage, yet occasionally opinions of an incomparable tactlessness [p. 427]
will just happen to him. These opinions have their source in his inferior and subconscious
thinking, which is only partly subject to control and is insufficiently related to the object ; to a
large extent, therefore, it can operate without consideration or responsibility.

In the extraverted attitude the inferior functions always reveal a highly subjective determination
with pronounced egocentricity and personal bias, thus demonstrating their close connection with
the unconscious. Through their agency the unconscious is continually coming to light. On no
account should we imagine that the unconscious lies permanently buried under so many
overlying strata that it can only be uncovered, so to speak, by a laborious process of excavation.
On the contrary, there is a constant influx of the unconscious into the conscious psychological
process; at times this reaches such a pitch that the observer can decide only with difficulty which
character-traits are to be ascribed to the conscious, and which to the unconscious personality.
This difficulty occurs mainly with persons whose habit of expression errs rather on the side of
profuseness. Naturally it depends very largely also upon the attitude of the observer, whether he
lays hold of the conscious or the unconscious character of a personality. Speaking generally a
judging observer will tend to seize the conscious character, while a perceptive observer will be
influenced more by the unconscious character, since judgement is chiefly interested in the
conscious motivation of the psychic process, while perception tends to register the mere
happening. But in so far as we apply perception and judgment in equal measure, it may easily
happen that a personality appears to us as both introverted and extraverted, so that we cannot at
once decide to which attitude the superior function belongs. In such cases only a thorough

analysis of the function qualities can help us to a sound opinion. During the analysis we must
observe which [p. 428] function is placed under the control and motivation of consciousness, and
which functions have an accidental and spontaneous character. The former is always more highly
differentiated than the latter, which also possess many infantile and primitive qualities.
Occasionally the former function gives the impression of normality, while the latter have
something abnormal or pathological about them.

(III) THE PECULIARITIES OF THE BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN THE
EXTRAVERTED ATTITUDE

1. Thinking

As a result of the general attitude of extraversion, thinking is orientated by the object and
objective data. This orientation of thinking produces a noticeable peculiarity.

Thinking in general is fed from two sources, firstly from subjective and in the last resort
unconscious roots, and secondly from objective data transmitted through sense perceptions.

Extraverted thinking is conditioned in a larger measure by these latter factors than by the former.
judgment always presupposes a criterion ; for the extraverted judgment, the valid and
determining criterion is the standard taken from objective conditions, no matter whether this be
directly represented by an objectively perceptible fact, or expressed in an objective idea ; for an
objective idea, even when subjectively sanctioned, is equally external and objective in origin.
Extraverted thinking, therefore, need not necessarily be a merely concretistic thinking it may
equally well be a purely ideal thinking, if, for instance, it can be shown that the ideas with which
it is engaged are to a great extent borrowed from without, i.e. are transmitted by tradition and
education. The criterion of judgment, therefore, as to whether or no a thinking is extraverted,
hangs directly upon the question: by [p. 429] which standard is its judgment governed -- is it
furnished from without, or is its origin subjective? A further criterion is afforded by the direction
of the thinker's conclusion, namely, whether or no the thinking has a preferential direction
outwards. It is no proof of its extraverted nature that it is preoccupied with concrete objects,
since I may be engaging my thoughts with a concrete object, either because I am abstracting my
thought from it or because I am concretizing my thought with it. Even if I engage my thinking
with concrete things, and to that extent could be described as extraverted, it yet remains both
questionable and characteristic as regards the direction my thinking will take; namely, whether in
its further course it leads back again to objective data, external facts, and generally accepted
ideas, or not. So far as the practical thinking of the merchant, the engineer, or the natural science
pioneer is concerned, the objective direction is at once manifest. But in the case of a philosopher
it is open to doubt, whenever the course of his thinking is directed towards ideas. In such a case,
before deciding, we must further enquire whether these ideas are mere abstractions from
objective experience, in which case they would merely represent higher collective concepts,
comprising a sum of objective facts ; or whether (if they are clearly not abstractions from
immediate experience) they may not be derived from tradition or borrowed from the intellectual
atmosphere of the time. In the latter event, such ideas must also belong to the category of
objective data, in which case this thinking should also be called extraverted.

Although I do not propose to present the nature of introverted thinking at this point, reserving it
for a later section, it is, however, essential that I should make a few statements about it before
going further. For if one considers strictly what I have just said concerning [p. 430] extraverted
thinking, one might easily conclude that such a statement includes everything that is generally
understood as thinking. It might indeed be argued that a thinking whose aim is concerned neither
with objective facts nor with general ideas scarcely merits the name 'thinking'. I am fully aware
of the fact that the thought of our age, in common with its most eminent representatives, knows
and acknowledges only the extraverted type of thinking. This is partly due to the fact that all
thinking which attains visible form upon the world's surface, whether as science, philosophy, or
even art, either proceeds direct from objects or flows into general ideas. On either ground,
although not always completely evident it at least appears essentially intelligible, and therefore
relatively valid. In this sense it might be said that the extraverted intellect, i.e. the mind that is
orientated by objective data, is actually the only one recognized.

There is also, however -- and now I come to the question of the introverted intellect -- an entirely
different kind of thinking, to which the term I "thinking" can hardly be denied: it is a kind that is
neither orientated by the immediate objective experience nor is it concerned with general and
objectively derived ideas. I reach this other kind of thinking in the following way. When my
thoughts are engaged with a concrete object or general idea in such a way that the course of my
thinking eventually leads me back again to my object, this intellectual process is not the only
psychic proceeding taking place in me at the moment. I will disregard all those possible
sensations and feelings which become noticeable as a more or less disturbing accompaniment to
my train of thought, merely emphasizing the fact that this very thinking process which proceeds
from objective data and strives again towards the object stands also in a constant relation to the
subject. This relation is a condition sine qua non, without which no think- [p. 431] ing process
whatsoever could take place. Even though my thinking process is directed, as far as possible,
towards objective data, nevertheless it is my subjective process, and it can neither escape the
subjective admixture nor yet dispense with it. Although I try my utmost to give a completely
objective direction to my train of thought, even then I cannot exclude the parallel subjective
process with its all-embracing participation, without extinguishing the very spark of life from my
thought. This parallel subjective process has a natural tendency, only relatively avoidable, to
subjectify objective facts, i.e. to assimilate them to the subject.

Whenever the chief value is given to the subjective process, that other kind of thinking arises
which stands opposed to extraverted thinking, namely, that purely subjective orientation of
thought which I have termed introverted. A thinking arises from this other orientation that is
neither determined by objective facts nor directed towards objective data -- a thinking, therefore,
that proceeds from subjective data and is directed towards subjective ideas or facts of a
subjective character. I do not wish to enter more fully into this kind of thinking here; I have
merely established its existence for the purpose of giving a necessary complement to the
extraverted thinking process, whose nature is thus brought to a clearer focus.

When the objective orientation receives a certain predominance, the thinking is extraverted. This
circumstance changes nothing as regards the logic of thought -- it merely determines that
difference between thinkers which James regards as a matter of temperament. The orientation
towards the object, as already explained, makes no essential change in the thinking function;

only its appearance is altered. Since it is governed by objective data, it has the appearance of
being captivated by the object, as though without the external orientation it simply could not [p.
432] exist. Almost it seems as though it were a sequence of external facts, or as though it could
reach its highest point only when chiming in with some generally valid idea. It seems constantly
to be affected by objective data, drawing only those conclusions which substantially agree with
these. Thus it gives one the impression of a certain lack of freedom, of occasional short-
sightedness, in spite of every kind of adroitness within the objectively circumscribed area. What
I am now describing is merely the impression this sort of thinking makes upon the observer, who
must himself already have a different standpoint, or it would be quite impossible for him to
observe the phenomenon of extraverted thinking. As a result of his different standpoint he
merely sees its aspect, not its nature; whereas the man who himself possesses this type of
thinking is able to seize its nature, while its aspect escapes him. judgment made upon appearance
only cannot be fair to the essence of the thing-hence the result is depreciatory. But essentially
this thinking is no less fruitful and creative than introverted thinking, only its powers are in the
service of other ends. This difference is perceived most clearly when extraverted thinking is
engaged upon material, which is specifically an object of the subjectively orientated thinking.
This happens, for instance, when a subjective conviction is interpreted analytically from
objective facts or is regarded as a product or derivative of objective ideas. But, for our
'scientifically' orientated consciousness, the difference between the two modes of thinking
becomes still more obvious when the subjectively orientated thinking makes an attempt to bring
objective data into connections not objectively given, i.e. to subordinate them to a subjective
idea. Either senses the other as an encroachment, and hence a sort of shadow effect is produced,
wherein either type reveals to the other its least favourable aspect, The subjectively orientated
thinking then appears [p. 433] quite arbitrary, while the extraverted thinking seems to have an
incommensurability that is altogether dull and banal. Thus the two standpoints are incessantly at
war.

Such a conflict, we might think, could be easily adjusted if only we clearly discriminated objects
of a subjective from those of an objective nature. Unfortunately, however, such a discrimination
is a matter of impossibility, although not a few have attempted it. Even if such a separation were
possible, it would be a very disastrous proceeding, since in themselves both orientations are one-
sided, with a definitely restricted validity; hence they both require this mutual correction.
Thought is at once sterilized, whenever thinking is brought, to any great extent, under the
influence of objective data, since it becomes degraded into a mere appendage of objective facts;
in which case, it is no longer able to free itself from objective data for the purpose of establishing
an abstract idea. The process of thought is reduced to mere 'reflection', not in the sense of
'meditation', but in the sense of a mere imitation that makes no essential affirmation beyond what
was already visibly and immediately present in the objective data. Such a thinking-process leads
naturally and directly back to the objective fact, but never beyond it ; not once, therefore, can it
lead to the coupling of experience with an objective idea. And, vice versa, when this thinking has
an objective idea for its object, it is quite unable to grasp the practical individual experience, but
persists in a more or less tautological position. The materialistic mentality presents a magnificent
example of this.

When, as the result of a reinforced objective determination, extraverted thinking is subordinated
to objective data, it entirely loses itself, on the one hand, in the individual experience, and

proceeds to amass an accumulation of undigested empirical material. The oppressive mass of
more or less disconnected individual experiences [p. 434] produces a state of intellectual
dissociation, which, on the other hand, usually demands a psychological compensation. This
must consist in an idea, just as simple as it is universal, which shall give coherence to the
heaped-up but intrinsically disconnected whole, or at least it should provide an inkling of such a
connection. Such ideas as "matter" or "energy" are suitable for this purpose. But, whenever
thinking primarily depends not so much upon external facts as upon an accepted or second-hand
idea, the very poverty of the idea provokes a compensation in the form of a still more impressive
accumulation of facts, which assume a one-sided grouping in keeping with the relatively
restricted and sterile point of view; whereupon many valuable and sensible aspects of things
automatically go by the board. The vertiginous abundance of the socalled scientific literature of
to-day owes a deplorably high percentage of its existence to this misorientation.

2. The Extraverted Thinking Type

It is a fact of experience that all the basic psychological functions seldom or never have the same
strength or grade of development in one and the same individual. As a rule, one or other function
predominates, in both strength and development. When supremacy among the psychological
functions is given to thinking, i.e. when the life of an individual is mainly ruled by reflective
thinking so that every important action proceeds from intellectually considered motives, or when
there is at least a tendency to conform to such motives, we may fairly call this a thinking type.
Such a type can be either introverted or extraverted. We will first discuss the extraverted thinking
type.

In accordance with his definition, we must picture a, man whose constant aim -- in so far, of
course, as he is a [p. 435] pure type -- is to bring his total life-activities into relation with
intellectual conclusions, which in the last resort are always orientated by objective data, whether
objective facts or generally valid ideas. This type of man gives the deciding voice-not merely for
himself alone but also on behalf of his entourage-either to the actual objective reality or to its
objectively orientated, intellectual formula. By this formula are good and evil measured, and
beauty and ugliness determined. All is right that corresponds with this formula; all is wrong that
contradicts it; and everything that is neutral to it is purely accidental. Because this formula seems
to correspond with the meaning of the world, it also becomes a world-law whose realization must
be achieved at all times and seasons, both individually and collectively. Just as the extraverted
thinking type subordinates himself to his formula, so, for its own good, must his entourage also
obey it, since the man who refuses to obey is wrong -- he is resisting the world-law, and is,
therefore, unreasonable, immoral, and without a conscience. His moral code forbids him to
tolerate exceptions; his ideal must, under all circumstances, be realized; for in his eyes it is the
purest conceivable formulation of objective reality, and, therefore, must also be generally valid
truth, quite indispensable for the salvation of man. This is not from any great love for his
neighbour, but from a higher standpoint of justice and truth. Everything in his own nature that
appears to invalidate this formula is mere imperfection, an accidental miss-fire, something to be
eliminated on the next occasion, or, in the event of further failure, then clearly a sickness.

If tolerance for the sick, the suffering, or the deranged should chance to be an ingredient in the
formula, special provisions will be devised for humane societies, hospitals, prisons, colonies,

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

14

etc., or at least extensive plans for such projects. For the actual execution of these schemes the
[p. 436] motives of justice and truth do not, as a rule, suffice; still devolve upon real Christian
charity, which I to do with feeling than with any intellectual 'One really should' or I one must'
figure largely in this programme. If the formula is wide enough, it may play a very useful rôle in
social life, with a reformer or a ventilator of public wrongs or a purifier of the public conscience,
or as the propagator of important innovations. But the more rigid the formula, the more, does he
develop into a grumbler, a crafty reasoner, and a self-righteous critic, who would like to impress
both himself and others into one schema.

We have now outlined two extreme figures, between which terminals the majority of these types
may be graduated.

In accordance with the nature of the extraverted attitude, the influence and activities of such
personalities are all the more favourable and beneficent, the further one goes from the centre.
Their best aspect is to be found at the periphery of their sphere of influence. The further we
penetrate into their own province, the more do the unfavourable results of their tyranny impress
us. Another life still pulses at the periphery, where the truth of the formula can be sensed as an
estimable adjunct to the rest. But the further we probe into the special sphere where the formula
operates, the more do we find life ebbing away from all that fails to coincide with its dictates.
Usually it is the nearest relatives who have to taste the most disagreeable results of an
extraverted formula, since they are the first to be unmercifully blessed with it. But above all the
subject himself is the one who suffers most -- which brings us to the other side of the psychology
of this type.

The fact that an intellectual formula never has been and never will be discovered which could
embrace the [p. 437] abundant possibilities of life in a fitting expression must lead -- where such
a formula is accepted -- to an inhibition, or total exclusion, of other highly important forms and
activities of life. In the first place, all those vital forms dependent upon feeling will become
repressed in such a type, as, for instance, aesthetic activities, taste, artistic sense, the art of
friendship, etc. Irrational forms, such as religious experiences, passions and the like, are often
obliterated even to the point of complete unconsciousness. These, conditionally quite important,
forms of life have to support an existence that is largely unconscious. Doubtless there are
exceptional men who are able to sacrifice their entire life to one definite formula; but for most of
us a permanent life of such exclusiveness is impossible. Sooner or later -- in accordance with
outer circumstances and inner gifts -- the forms of life repressed by the intellectual attitude
become indirectly perceptible, through a gradual disturbance of the conscious conduct of life.
Whenever disturbances of this kind reach a definite intensity, one speaks of a neurosis. In most
cases, however, it does not go so far, because the individual instinctively allows himself some
preventive extenuations of his formula, worded, of course, in a suitable and reasonable way. In
this way a safety-valve is created.

The relative or total unconsciousness of such tendencies or functions as are excluded from any
participation in the conscious attitude keeps them in a relatively undeveloped state. As compared
with the conscious function they are inferior. To the extent that they are unconscious, they
become merged with the remaining contents of the unconscious, from which they acquire a

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

15

bizarre character. To the extent that they are conscious, they only play a secondary rôle, although
one of considerable importance for the whole psychological picture.

Since feelings are the first to oppose and contradict [p. 438] the rigid intellectual formula, they
are affected first this conscious inhibition, and upon them the most intense repression falls. No
function can be entirely eliminated -- it can only be greatly distorted. In so far as feelings allow
themselves to be arbitrarily shaped and subordinated, they have to support the intellectual
conscious attitude and adapt themselves to its aims. Only to a certain degree, however, is this
possible; a part of the feeling remains insubordinate, and therefore must be repressed. Should the
repression succeed, it disappears from consciousness and proceeds to unfold a subconscious
activity, which runs counter to conscious aims, even producing effects whose causation is a
complete enigma to the individual. For example, conscious altruism, often of an extremely high
order, may be crossed by a secret self-seeking, of which the individual is wholly unaware, and
which impresses intrinsically unselfish actions with the stamp of selfishness. Purely ethical aims
may lead the individual into critical situations, which sometimes have more than a semblance of
being decided by quite other than ethical motives. There are guardians of public morals or
voluntary rescue-workers who suddenly find themselves in deplorably compromising situations,
or in dire need of rescue. Their resolve to save often leads them to employ means which only
tend to precipitate what they most desire to avoid. There are extraverted idealists, whose desire
to advance the salvation of man is so consuming that they will not shrink from any lying and
dishonest means in the pursuit of their ideal. There are a few painful examples in science where
investigators of the highest esteem, from a profound conviction of the truth and general validity
of their formula, have not scrupled to falsify evidence in favour of their ideal. This is sanctioned
by the formula; the end justifieth the means. Only an inferior feeling-function, operating
seductively [p. 439] and unconsciously, could bring about such aberrations in otherwise
reputable men.

The inferiority of feeling in this type manifests itself also in other ways. In so far as it
corresponds with the dominating positive formula, the conscious attitude becomes more or less
impersonal, often, indeed, to such a degree that a very considerable wrong is done to personal
interests. When the conscious attitude is extreme, all personal considerations recede from view,
even those which concern the individual's own person. His health is neglected, his social position
deteriorates, often the most vital interests of his family are violated -- they are wronged morally
and financially, even their bodily health is made to suffer -- all in the service of the ideal. At all
events personal sympathy with others must be impaired, unless they too chance to be in the
service of the same formula. Hence it not infrequently happens that his immediate family circle,
his own children for instance, only know such a father as a cruel tyrant, whilst the outer world
resounds with the fame of his humanity. Not so much in spite of as because of the highly
impersonal character of the conscious attitude, the unconscious feelings are highly personal and
oversensitive, giving rise to certain secret prejudices, as, for instance, a decided readiness to
misconstrue any objective opposition to his formula as personal ill-will, or a constant tendency to
make negative suppositions regarding the qualities of others in order to invalidate their
arguments beforehand-in defence, naturally, of his own susceptibility. As a result of this
unconscious sensitiveness, his expression and tone frequently becomes sharp, pointed,
aggressive, and insinuations multiply. The feelings have an untimely and halting character,
which is always a mark of the inferior function. Hence arises a pronounced tendency to

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

16

resentment. However generous the individual sacrifice [p. 440] to the intellectual goal may be,
the feelings are correspondingly petty, suspicious, crossgrained, and conservative. Everything
new that is not already contained formula is viewed through a veil of unconscious and is judged
accordingly. It happened only in middle of last century that a certain physician, famed his
humanitarianism, threatened to dismiss an assistant for daring to use a thermometer, because the
formula decreed that fever shall be recognized by the pulse. There are, of course, a host of
similar examples.

Thinking which in other respects may be altogether blameless becomes all the more subtly and
prejudicially, affected, the more feelings are repressed. An intellectual standpoint, which,
perhaps on account of its actual intrinsic value, might justifiably claim general recognition,
undergoes a characteristic alteration through the influence of this unconscious personal
sensitiveness; it becomes rigidly dogmatic. The personal self-assertion is transferred to the
intellectual standpoint. Truth is no longer left to work her natural effect, but through an
identification with the subject she is treated like a sensitive darling whom an evil-minded critic
has wronged. The critic is demolished, if possible with personal invective, and no argument is
too gross to be used against him. Truth must be trotted out, until finally it begins to dawn upon
the public that it is not so much really a question of truth as of her personal procreator.

The dogmatism of the intellectual standpoint, however, occasionally undergoes still further
peculiar modifications from the unconscious admixture of unconscious personal feelings; these
changes are less a question of feeling, in the stricter sense, than of contamination from other
unconscious factors which become blended with the repressed feeling in the unconscious.
Although reason itself offers proof, that every intellectual formula can be no more than [p. 441] a
partial truth, and can never lay claim, therefore, to autocratic authority; in practice, the formula
obtains so great an ascendancy that, beside it, every other standpoint and possibility recedes into
the background. It replaces all the more general, less defined, hence the more modest and
truthful, views of life. It even takes the place of that general view of life which we call religion.
Thus the formula becomes a religion, although in essentials it has not the smallest connection
with anything religious. Therewith it also gains the essentially religious character of
absoluteness. It becomes, as it were, an intellectual superstition. But now all those psychological
tendencies that suffer under its repression become grouped together in the unconscious, and form
a counter-position, giving rise to paroxysms of doubt. As a defence against doubt, the conscious
attitude grows fanatical. For fanaticism, after all, is merely overcompensated doubt. Ultimately
this development leads to an exaggerated defence of the conscious position, and to the gradual
formation of an absolutely antithetic unconscious position; for example, an extreme irrationality
develops, in opposition to the conscious rationalism, or it becomes highly archaic and
superstitious, in opposition to a conscious standpoint imbued with modern science. This fatal
opposition is the source of those narrow-minded and ridiculous views, familiar to the historians
of science, into which many praiseworthy pioneers have ultimately blundered. It not infrequently
happens in a man of this type that the side of the unconscious becomes embodied in a woman.

In my experience, this type, which is doubtless familiar to my readers, is chiefly found among
men, since thinking tends to be a much more dominant function in men than in women. As a
rule, when thinking achieves the mastery in women, it is, in my experience, a kind of thinking
which results from a prevailingly intuitive activity of mind. [p. 442]

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

The thought of the extraverted thinking type is, positive, i.e. it produces. It either leads to new
facts or to general conceptions of disparate experimental material. Its judgment is generally
synthetic. Even when it analyses, it constructs, because it is always advancing beyond the,
analysis to a new combination, a further conception which reunites the analysed material in a
new way or adds some., thing further to the given material. In general, therefore, we may
describe this kind of judgment as predicative. In any case, characteristic that it is never
absolutely depreciatory or destructive, but always substitutes a fresh value for one that is
demolished. This quality is due to the fact that thought is the main channel into which a thinking-
type's energy flows. Life steadily advancing shows itself in the man's thinking, so that his ideas
maintain a progressive, creative character. His thinking neither stagnates, nor is it in the least
regressive. Such qualities cling only to a thinking that is not given priority in consciousness. In
this event it is relatively unimportant, and also lacks the character of a positive vital activity. It
follows in the wake of other functions, it becomes Epimethean, it has an 'esprit de l'escalier'
quality, contenting itself with constant ponderings and broodings upon things past and gone, in
an effort to analyse and digest them. Where the creative element, as in this case, inhabits another
function, thinking no longer progresses it stagnates. Its judgment takes on a decided inherency-
character, i.e. it entirely confines itself to the range of the given material, nowhere overstepping
it. It is contented with a more or less abstract statement, and fails to impart any value to the
experimental material that was not already there.

The inherency-judgment of such extraverted thinking is objectively orientated, i.e. its conclusion
always expresses the objective importance of experience. Hence, not only does it remain under
the orientating influence of objective [p. 443]

data, but it actually rests within the charmed circle of the individual experience, about which it
affirms nothing that was not already given by it. We may easily observe this thinking in those
people who cannot refrain from tacking on to an impression or experience some rational and
doubtless very valid remark, which, however, in no way adventures beyond the given orbit of the
experience. At bottom, such a remark merely says 'I have understood it -- I can reconstruct it.'
But there the matter also ends. At its very highest, such a judgment signifies merely the placing
of an experience in an objective setting, whereby the experience is at once recognized as
belonging to the frame.

But whenever a function other than thinking possesses priority in consciousness to any marked
degree, in so far as thinking is conscious at all and not directly dependent upon the dominant
function, it assumes a negative character. In so far as it is subordinated to the dominant function,
it may actually wear a positive aspect, but a narrower scrutiny will easily prove that it simply
mimics the dominant function, supporting it with arguments that unmistakably contradict the
laws of logic proper to thinking. Such a thinking, therefore, ceases to have any interest for our
present discussion. Our concern is rather with the constitution of that thinking which cannot be
subordinated to the dominance of another function, but remains true to its own principle. To
observe and investigate this thinking in itself is not easy, since, in the concrete case, it is more or
less constantly repressed by the conscious attitude. Hence, in the majority of cases, it first must
be retrieved from the background of consciousness, unless in some unguarded moment it should
chance to come accidentally to the surface. As a rule, it must be enticed with some such
questions as 'Now what do you really think?' or, again, 'What is your private view [p. 444] about

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

18

the matter?' Or perhaps one may even use a little cunning, framing the question something this:
'What do you imagine, then, that I really think about the matter?' This latter form should be
chosen when the real thinking is unconscious and, therefore projected. The thinking that is
enticed to the surface this way has characteristic qualities; it was these I had in mind just now
when I described it as negative. It habitual mode is best characterized by the two words 'nothing
but'. Goethe personified this thinking in the figure of Mephistopheles. It shows a most distinctive
tendency to trace back the object of its judgment to some banality or other, thus stripping it of its
own independent significance. This happens simply because it is represented as being dependent
upon some other commonplace thing. Wherever a conflict, apparently essential in nature, arises
between two men, negative thinking mutters 'Cherchez la femme'. When a man champions or
advocates a cause, negative thinking makes no inquiry as to the importance of the thing, but
merely asks 'How much does he make by it?' The dictum ascribed to Moleschott: "Der Mensch
ist, was er isst" (" Man is what he eats ") also belongs to this collection, as do many more
aphorisms and opinions which I need not enumerate.

The destructive quality of this thinking as well as its occasional and limited usefulness, hardly
need further elucidation. But there still exists another form of negative thinking, which at first
glance perhaps would scarcely be recognized as such I refer to the theosophical thinking which
is to-day rapidly spreading in every quarter of the globe, presumably as a reaction phenomenon
to the materialism of the epoch now receding. Theosophical thinking has an air that is not in the
least reductive, since it exalts everything to transcendental and world-embracing ideas. A dream,
for instance, is no [p. 445] longer a modest dream, but an experience upon 'another plane'. The
hitherto inexplicable fact of telepathy is ,very simply explained by 'vibrations' which pass from
one man to another. An ordinary nervous trouble is quite simply accounted for by the fact that
something has collided with the astral body. Certain anthropological peculiarities of the dwellers
on the Atlantic seaboard are easily explained by the submerging of Atlantis, and so on. We have
merely to open a theosophical book to be overwhelmed by the realization that everything is
already explained, and that 'spiritual science' has left no enigmas of life unsolved. But,
fundamentally, this sort of thinking is just as negative as materialistic thinking. When the latter
conceives psychology as chemical changes taking place in the cell-ganglia, or as the extrusion
and withdrawal of cell-processes, or as an internal secretion, in essence this is just as
superstitious as theosophy. The only difference lies in the fact that materialism reduces all
phenomena to our current physiological notions, while theosophy brings everything into the
concepts of Indian metaphysics. When we trace the dream to an overloaded stomach, the dream
is not thereby explained, and when we explain telepathy as 'vibrations', we have said just as little.
Since, what are 'vibrations'? Not only are both methods of explanation quite impotent -- they are
actually destructive, because by interposing their seeming explanations they withdraw interest
from the problem, diverting it in the former case to the stomach, and in the latter to imaginary
vibrations, thus preventing any serious investigation of the problem. Either kind of thinking is
both sterile and sterilizing. Their negative quality consists in this it is a method of thought that is
indescribably cheap there is a real poverty of productive and creative energy. It is a thinking
taken in tow by other functions. [p. 446]

3. Feeling

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

19

Feeling in the extraverted attitude is orientated by objective data, i.e. the object is the
indispensable determinant of the kind of feeling. It agrees with objective values. If one has
always known feeling as a subjective fact, the nature of extraverted feeling will not immediately
be understood, since it has freed itself as fully as possible from the subjective factor, and has,
instead, become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object. Even where it seems to show
a certain independence of the quality of the concrete object, it is none the less under the spell of.
traditional or generally valid standards of some sort. I may feel constrained, for instance, to use
the predicate 'beautiful' or 'good', not because I find the object 'beautiful' or 'good' from my own
subjective feeling, but because it is fitting and politic so to do; and fitting it certainly is,
inasmuch as a contrary opinion would disturb the general feeling situation. A feeling-judgment
such as this is in no way a simulation or a lie -- it is merely an act of accommodation. A picture,
for instance, may be termed beautiful, because a picture that is hung in a drawing-room and
bearing a well-known signature is generally assumed to be beautiful, or because the predicate
'ugly' might offend the family of the fortunate possessor, or because there is a benevolent
intention on the part of the visitor to create a pleasant feeling-atmosphere, to which end
everything must be felt as agreeable. Such feelings are governed by the standard of the objective
determinants. As such they are genuine, and represent the total visible feeling-function.

In precisely the same way as extraverted thinking strives to rid itself of subjective influences,
extraverted feeling has also to undergo a certain process of differentiation, before it is finally
denuded of every subjective [p. 447] trimming. The valuations resulting from the act of feeling
either correspond directly with objective values or at least chime in with certain traditional and
generally known standards of value. This kind of feeling is very largely responsible for the fact
that so many people flock to the theatre, to concerts, or to Church, and what is more, with
correctly adjusted positive feelings. Fashions, too, owe their existence to it, and, what is far more
valuable, the whole positive and wide-spread support of social, philanthropic, and such like
cultural enterprises. In such matters, extraverted feeling proves itself a creative factor. Without
this feeling, for instance, a beautiful and harmonious sociability would be unthinkable. So far
extraverted feeling is just as beneficent and rationally effective as extraverted thinking. But this
salutary effect is lost as soon as the object gains an exaggerated influence. For, when this
happens, extraverted feeling draws the personality too much into the object, i.e. the object
assimilates the person, whereupon the personal character of the feeling, which constitutes its
principal charm, is lost. Feeling then becomes cold, material, untrustworthy. It betrays a secret
aim, or at least arouses the suspicion of it in an impartial observer. No longer does it make that
welcome and refreshing impression the invariable accompaniment of genuine feeling; instead,
one scents a pose or affectation, although the egocentric motive may be entirely unconscious.

Such overstressed, extraverted feeling certainly fulfils æsthetic expectations, but no longer does
it speak to the heart; it merely appeals to the senses, or -- worse still -- to the reason. Doubtless it
can provide æsthetic padding for a situation, but there it stops, and beyond that its effect is nil. It
has become sterile. Should this process go further, a strangely contradictory dissociation of
feeling develops; every object is seized upon with feeling- [p. 448] valuations, and numerous
relationships are made which are inherently and mutually incompatible. Since such aberrations
would be quite impossible if a sufficiently emphasized subject were present, the last vestige of a
real personal standpoint also becomes suppressed. The subject becomes so swallowed up in
individual feeling processes that to the observer it seems as though there were no longer a subject

of feeling but merely a feeling process. In such a condition feeling has entirely forfeited its
original human warmth, it gives an impression of pose, inconstancy, unreliability, and in the
worst cases appears definitely hysterical.

4. The Extraverted Feeling-Type

In so far as feeling is, incontestably, a more obvious peculiarity of feminine psychology than
thinking, the most pronounced feeling-types are also to be found among women. When
extraverted feeling possesses the priority we speak of an extraverted feeling-type. Examples of
this type that I can call to mind are, almost without exception, women. She is a woman who
follows the guiding-line of her feeling. As the result of education her feeling has become
developed into an adjusted function, subject to conscious control. Except in extreme cases,
feeling has a personal character, in spite of the fact that the subjective factor may be already, to a
large extent, repressed. The personality appears to be adjusted in relation to objective conditions.
Her feelings correspond with objective situations and general values. Nowhere is this more
clearly revealed than in the so-called 'love-choice'; the 'suitable' man is loved, not another one; he
is suitable not so much because he fully accords with the fundamental character of the woman --
as a rule she is quite uninformed about this -- but because [p. 449] he meticulously corresponds
in standing, age, capacity, height, and family respectability with every reasonable requirement.
Such a formulation might, of course, be easily rejected as ironical or depreciatory, were I not
fully convinced that the love-feeling of this type of woman completely corresponds with her
choice. It is genuine, and not merely intelligently manufactured. Such 'reasonable' marriages
exist without number, and they are by no means the worst. Such women are good comrades to
their husbands and excellent mothers, so long as husbands or children possess the conventional
psychic constitution. One can feel 'correctly', however, only when feeling is disturbed by nothing
else. But nothing disturbs feeling so much as thinking. It is at once intelligible, therefore, that
this type should repress thinking as much as possible. This does not mean to say that such a
woman does not think at all; on the contrary, she may even think a great deal and very ably, but
her thinking is never sui generis; it is, in fact, an Epimethean appendage to her feeling. What she
cannot feel, she cannot consciously think. 'But I can't think what I don't feel', such a type said to
me once in indignant tones. As far as feeling permits, she can think very well, but every
conclusion, however logical, that might lead to a disturbance of feeling is rejected from the
outset. It is simply not thought. And thus everything that corresponds with objective valuations is
good: these things are loved or treasured; the rest seems merely to exist in a world apart.

But a change comes over the picture when the importance of the object reaches a still higher
level. As already explained above, such an assimilation of subject to object then occurs as almost
completely to engulf the subject of feeling. Feeling loses its personal character -- it becomes
feeling per se; it almost seems as though the [p. 450] personality were wholly dissolved in the
feeling of the moment. Now, since in actual life situations constantly and successively alternate,
in which the feeling-tones released are not only different but are actually mutually contrasting,
the personality inevitably becomes dissipated in just so many different feelings. Apparently, he is
this one moment, and something completely different the next -- apparently, I repeat, for in
reality such a manifold personality is altogether impossible. The basis of the ego always remains
identical with itself, and, therefore, appears definitely opposed to the changing states of feeling.
Accordingly the observer senses the display of feeling not so much as a personal expression of

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

21

the feeling-subject as an alteration of his ego, a mood, in other words. Corresponding with the
degree of dissociation between the ego and the momentary state of feeling, signs of disunion
with the self will become more or less evident, i.e. the original compensatory attitude of the
unconscious becomes a manifest opposition. This reveals itself, in the first instance, in
extravagant demonstrations of feeling, in loud and obtrusive feeling predicates, which leave one,
however, somewhat incredulous. They ring hollow; they are not convincing. On the contrary,
they at once give one an inkling of a resistance that is being overcompensated, and one begins to
wonder whether such a feeling-judgment might not just as well be entirely different. In fact, in a
very short time it actually is different. Only a very slight alteration in the situation is needed to
provoke forthwith an entirely contrary estimation of the selfsame object. The result of such an
experience is that the observer is unable to take either judgment at all seriously. He begins to
reserve his own opinion. But since, with this type, it is a matter of the greatest moment to
establish an intensive feeling rapport with his environment, redoubled efforts are now required
[p. 451] to overcome this reserve. Thus, in the manner of the circulus vitiosus, the situation goes
from bad to worse. The more the feeling relation with the object becomes overstressed, the
nearer the unconscious opposition approaches the surface.

We have already seen that the extraverted feeling type, as a rule, represses his thinking, just
because thinking is the function most liable to disturb feeling. Similarly, when thinking seeks to
arrive at pure results of any kind, its first act is to exclude feeling, since nothing is calculated to
harass and falsify thinking so much as feeling-values. Thinking, therefore, in so far as it is an
independent function, is repressed in the extraverted feeling type. Its repression, as I observed
before, is complete only in so far as its inexorable logic forces it to conclusions that are
incompatible with feeling. It is suffered to exist as the servant of feeling, or more accurately its
slave. Its backbone is broken; it may not operate on its own account, in accordance with its own
laws, Now, since a logic exists producing inexorably right conclusions, this must happen
somewhere, although beyond the bounds of consciousness, i.e. in the unconscious. Pre-
eminently, therefore, the unconscious content of this type is a particular kind of thinking. It is an
infantile, archaic, and negative thinking.

So long as conscious feeling preserves the personal character, or, in other words, so long as the
personality does not become swallowed up by successive states of feeling, this unconscious
thinking remains compensatory. But as soon as the personality is dissociated, becoming
dispersed in mutually contradictory states of feeling, the identity of the ego is lost, and the
subject becomes unconscious. But, because of the subject's lapse into the unconscious, it
becomes associated with the unconscious thinking -- function, therewith assisting the
unconscious [p. 452] thought to occasional consciousness. The stronger the conscious feeling
relation, and therefore, the more 'depersonalized,' it becomes, the stronger grows the unconscious
opposition. This reveals itself in the fact that unconscious ideas centre round just the most valued
objects, which are thus pitilessly stripped of their value. That thinking which always thinks in the
'nothing but' style is in its right place here, since it destroys the ascendancy of the feeling that is
chained to the object.

Unconscious thought reaches the surface in the form of irruptions, often of an obsessing nature,
the general character of which is always negative and depreciatory. Women of this type have
moments when the most hideous thoughts fasten upon the very objects most valued by their

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

22

feelings. This negative thinking avails itself of every infantile prejudice or parallel that is
calculated to breed doubt in the feeling-value, and it tows every primitive instinct along with it,
in the effort to make 'a nothing but' interpretation of the feeling. At this point, it is perhaps in the
nature of a side-remark to observe that the collective unconscious, i.e. the totality of the
primordial images, also becomes enlisted in the same manner, and from the elaboration and
development of these images there dawns the possibility of a regeneration of the attitude upon
another basis.

Hysteria, with the characteristic infantile sexuality of its unconscious world of ideas, is the
principal form of neurosis with this type.

5. Recapitulation of Extraverted Rational Types

I term the two preceding types rational or judging types because they are characterized by the
supremacy of the reasoning and the judging functions. It is a general distinguishing mark of both
types that their life is, to a [p. 453] large extent, subordinated to reasoning judgment. But we
must not overlook the point, whether by 'reasoning' we are referring to the standpoint of the
individual's subjective psychology, or to the standpoint of the observer, who perceives and
judges from without. For such an observer could easily arrive at an opposite judgment, especially
if he has a merely intuitive apprehension of the behaviour of the observed, and judges
accordingly. In its totality, the life of this type is never dependent upon reasoning judgment
alone; it is influenced in almost equal degree by unconscious irrationality. If observation is
restricted to behaviour, without any concern for the domestic interior of the individual's
consciousness, one may get an even stronger impression of the irrational and accidental character
of certain unconscious manifestations in the individual's behaviour than of the reasonableness of
his conscious purposes and motivations. I, therefore, base my judgment upon what the individual
feels to be his conscious psychology. But I am prepared to grant that we may equally well
entertain a precisely opposite conception of such a psychology, and present it accordingly. I am
also convinced that, had I myself chanced to possess a different individual psychology, I should
have described the rational types in the reversed way, from the standpoint of the unconscious-as
irrational, therefore. This circumstance aggravates the difficulty of a lucid presentation of
psychological matters to a degree not to be underestimated, and immeasurably increases the
possibility of misunderstandings. The discussions which develop from these misunderstandings
are, as a rule, quite hopeless, since the real issue is never joined, each side speaking, as it were,
in a different tongue. Such experience is merely one reason the more for basing my presentation
upon the subjective conscious psychology of the individual, since there, at least, one has a
definite objective footing, which completely [p. 454] drops away the moment we try to ground
psychological principles upon the unconscious. For the observed, in this case, could undertake no
kind of co-operation, because there is nothing of which he is not more informed than his own
unconscious. The judgment would entirely devolve upon the observer -- a certain guarantee that
its basis would be his own individual psychology, which would infallibly be imposed upon the
observed. To my mind, this is the case in the psychologies both of Freud and of Adler. The
individual is completely at the mercy of the arbitrary discretion of his observing critic -- which
can never be the case when the conscious psychology of the observed is accepted as the basis.
After all, he is the only competent judge, since he alone knows his own motives.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

23

The reasonableness that characterizes the conscious management of life in both these types,
involves a conscious exclusion of the accidental and non-rational. Reasoning judgment, in such a
psychology, represents a power that coerces the untidy and accidental things of life into definite
forms; such at least is its aim. Thus, on the one hand, a definite choice is made among the
possibilities of life, since only the rational choice is consciously accepted; but, on the other hand,
the independence and influence of those psychic functions which perceive life's happenings are
essentially restricted. This limitation of sensation and intuition is, of course, not absolute. These
functions exist, for they are universal; but their products are subject to the choice of the
reasoning judgment. It is not the absolute strength of sensation, for instance, which turns the
scales in the motivation of action, but judgment, Thus, in a certain sense, the perceiving-
functions share the same fate as feeling in the case of the first type, or thinking in that of the
second. They are relatively repressed, and therefore in an inferior state of differentiation. This
circumstance gives a particular stamp to the unconscious [p. 455] of both our types; what such
men do consciously and intentionally accords with reason (their reason of course), but what
happens to them corresponds either with infantile, primitive sensations, or with similarly archaic
intuitions. I will try to make clear what I mean by these latter concepts in the sections that
follow. At all events, that which happens to this type is irrational (from their own standpoint of
course). Now, since there are vast numbers of men whose lives consist in what happens to them
more than in actions resulting from reasoned intention, it might conceivably happen, that such a
man, after careful analysis, would describe both our types as irrational. We must grant him,
however, that only too often a man's unconscious makes a far stronger impression upon one than
his conscious, and that his actions often have considerably more weight and meaning than his
reasoned motivations.

The rationality of both types is orientated objectively, and depends upon objective data. Their
reasonableness corresponds with what passes as reasonable from the collective standpoint.
Subjectively they consider nothing rational save what is generally considered as such. But reason
is also very largely subjective and individual. In our case this share is repressed -- increasingly
so, in fact, the more the significance of the object is exalted, Both the subject and subjective
reason, therefore, are always threatened with repression and, when it descends, they fall under
the tyranny of the unconscious, which in this case possesses most unpleasant qualities. We have
already spoken of its thinking. But, in addition, there are primitive sensations, which reveal
themselves in compulsive forms, as, for instance, an abnormal compulsive pleasure seeking in
every conceivable direction ; there are also primitive intuitions, which can become a positive
torture to the individuals concerned, not to mention their entourage. Everything disagreeable and
painful, everything disgusting, [p. 456] ugly, and evil is scented out or suspected, and these as a
rule only correspond with half-truths, than which nothing is more calculated to create
misunderstandings of the most poisonous kind. The powerful influence of the opposing
unconscious contents necessarily brings about a frequent interruption of the rational conscious
government, namely, a striking subservience to the element of chance, so that, either by virtue of
their sensational value or unconscious significance, accidental happenings acquire a compelling
influence.

6. Sensation

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

24

Sensation, in the extraverted attitude, is most definitely conditioned by the object. As sense-
perception, sensation is naturally dependent upon the object. But, just as naturally, it is also
dependent upon the subject; hence, there is also a subjective sensation, which after its kind is
entirely different from the objective. In the extraverted attitude this subjective share of sensation,
in so far as its conscious application is concerned, is either inhibited or repressed. As an
irrational function, sensation is equally repressed, whenever a rational function, thinking or
feeling, possesses the priority, ie. it can be said to have a conscious function, only in so far as the
rational attitude of consciousness permits accidental perceptions to become conscious contents;
in short, realizes them. The function of sense is, of course, absolute in the stricter sense; for
example, everything is seen or heard to the farthest physiological possibility, but not everything
attains that threshold value which a perception must possess in order to be also apperceived. It is
a different matter when sensation itself possesses priority, instead of merely seconding another
function. In this case, no element of objective sensation is excluded and nothing repressed (with
the exception of the subjective share [p. 457] already mentioned). Sensation has a preferential
objective determination, and those objects which release the strongest sensation are decisive for
the individual's psychology. The result of this is a pronounced sensuous hold to the object.
Sensation, therefore, is a vital function, equipped with the potentest [sic] vital instinct. In so far
as objects release sensations, they matter; and, in so far as it lies within the power of sensation,
they are also fully accepted into consciousness, whether compatible with reasoned judgment or
not. As a function its sole criterion of value is the strength of the sensation as conditioned by its
objective qualities. Accordingly, all objective processes, in so far as they release sensations at all,
make their appearance in consciousness. It is, however, only concrete, sensuously perceived
objects or processes which excite sensations in the extraverted attitude; exclusively those, in fact,
which everyone in all times and places would sense as concrete. Hence, the orientation of such
an individual corresponds with purely concrete reality. The judging, rational functions are
subordinated to the concrete facts of sensation, and, accordingly, possess the qualities of inferior
differentiation, i.e. they are marked by a certain negativity, with infantile and archaic tendencies.
The function most affected by the repression, is, naturally, the one standing opposite to
sensation, viz. intuition, the function of unconscious perception.

7. The Extraverted Sensation Type

No other human type can equal the extraverted sensation-type in realism. His sense for objective
facts is extraordinarily developed. His life is an accumulation of actual experience with concrete
objects, and the more pronounced he is, the less use does he make of his experience. In certain
cases the events of his life hardly deserve [p. 458] the name 'experience'. He knows no better use
for this sensed 'experience' than to make it serve as a guide to fresh sensations; anything in the
least 'new' that comes within his circle of interest is forthwith turned to a sensational account and
is made to serve this end. In so far as one is disposed to regard a highly developed sense for
sheer actuality as very reasonable, will such men be esteemed rational. In reality, however, this is
by no means the case, since they are equally subject to the sensation of irrational, chance
happenings, as they are to rational behaviour.

Such a type -- the majority arc men apparently -- does not, of course, believe himself to be
'subject' to sensation. He would be much more inclined to ridicule this view as altogether
inconclusive, since, from his standpoint, sensation is the concrete manifestation of life -- it is

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

25

simply the fulness [sic] of actual living. His aim is concrete enjoyment, and his morality is
similarly orientated. For true enjoyment has its own special morality, its own moderation and
lawfulness, its own unselfishness and devotedness. It by no means follows that he is just sensual
or gross, for he may differentiate his sensation to the finest pitch of æsthetic purity without being
the least unfaithful, even in his most abstract sensations, to his principle of objective sensation.
Wulfen's Cicerone des r&uml;cksichtlosen Lebensgenusses is the unvarnished confession of a
type of this sort. From this point of view the book seems to me worth reading.

Upon the lower levels this is the man of tangible reality, with little tendency either for reflection
or commanding purpose. To sense the object, to have and if possible to enjoy sensations, is his
constant motive. He is by no means unlovable; on the contrary, he frequently has a charming and
lively capacity for enjoyment; he is sometimes a jolly fellow, and often a refined æsthete. [p.
459]

In the former case, the great problems of life hinge upon a good or indifferent dinner; in the
latter, they are questions of good taste. When he 'senses', everything essential has been said and
done. Nothing can be more than concrete and actual; conjectures that transcend or go beyond the
concrete are only permitted on condition that they enhance sensation. This need not be in any
way a pleasurable reinforcement, since this type is not a common voluptuary; he merely desires
the strongest sensation, and this, by his very nature, he can receive only from without. What
comes from within seems to him morbid and objectionable. In so far as lie thinks and feels, he
always reduces down to objective foundations, i.e. to influences coming from the object, quite
unperturbed by the most violent departures from logic. Tangible reality, under any conditions,
makes him breathe again. In this respect he is unexpectedly credulous. He will, without
hesitation, relate an obvious psychogenic symptom to the falling barometer, while the existence
of a psychic conflict seems to him a fantastic abnormality. His love is incontestably rooted in the
manifest attractions of the object. In so far as he is normal, he is conspicuously adjusted to
positive reality -- conspicuously, because his adjustment is always visible. His ideal is the actual;
in this respect he is considerate. He has no ideals related to ideas -- he has, therefore, no sort of
ground for maintaining a hostile attitude towards the reality of things and facts. This expresses
itself in all the externals of his life. He dresses well, according to his circumstances ; he keeps a
good table for his friends, who are either made comfortable or at least given to understand that
his fastidious taste is obliged to impose certain claims upon his entourage. He even convinces
one that certain sacrifices are decidedly worth while for the sake of style.

But the more sensation predominates, so that the [p. 460] sensing subject disappears behind the
sensation, the more unsatisfactory does this type become. Either he develops into a crude
pleasure-seeker or he becomes an unscrupulous, designing sybarite. Although the object is
entirely indispensable to him, yet, as something existing in and through itself, it is none the less
depreciated. It is ruthlessly violated and essentially ignored, since now its sole use is to stimulate
sensation. The hold upon the object is pushed to the utmost limit. The unconscious is,
accordingly, forced out of its me[accent]tier as a compensatory function and driven into open
opposition. But, above all, the repressed intuitions begin to assert themselves in the form of
projections upon the object. The strangest conjectures arise; in the case of a sexual object,
jealous phantasies and anxiety-states play a great role. More acute cases develop every sort of
phobia, and especially compulsive symptoms. The pathological contents have a remarkable air of

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

26

unreality, with a frequent moral or religious colouring. A pettifogging captiousness often
develops, or an absurdly scrupulous morality coupled with a primitive, superstitious and
'magical' religiosity, harking back to abstruse rites. All these things have their source in the
repressed inferior functions, which, in such cases, stand in harsh opposition to the conscious
standpoint; they wear, in fact, an aspect that is all the more striking because they appear to rest
upon the most absurd suppositions, in complete contrast to the conscious sense of reality. The
whole culture of thought and feeling seems, in this second personality, to be twisted into a
morbid primitiveness; reason is hair-splitting sophistry -- morality is dreary moralizing and
palpable Pharisaism -- religion is absurd superstition -- intuition, the noblest of human gifts, is a
mere personal subtlety, a sniffing into every corner; instead of searching the horizon, it recedes
to the narrowest gauge of human meanness. [p. 461]

The specially compulsive character of the neurotic symptoms represent the unconscious
counterweight to the laisser aller morality of a purely sensational attitude, which, from the
standpoint of rational judgment, accepts without discrimination, everything that happens.
Although this lack of basic principles in the sensation-type does not argue an absolute
lawlessness and lack of restraint, it at least deprives him of the quite essential restraining power
of judgment. Rational judgment represents a conscious coercion, which the rational type appears
to impose upon himself of his own free will. This compulsion overtakes the sensation-type from
the unconscious. Moreover, the rational type's link to the object, from the very existence of a
judgment, never means such an unconditioned relation as that which the sensation-type has with
the object. When his attitude reaches an abnormal one-sidedness, he is in danger of falling just as
deeply into the arms of the unconscious as he consciously clings to the object. When he becomes
neurotic, he is much harder to treat in the rational way, because the functions to which the
physician must appeal are in a relatively undifferentiated state; hence little or no trust can be
placed in them. Special means of bringing emotional pressure to bear are often needed to make
him at all conscious.

8. Intuition

Intuition as the function of unconscious perception is wholly directed upon outer objects in the
extraverted attitude. Because, in the main, intuition is an unconscious process, the conscious
apprehension of its nature is a very difficult matter. In consciousness, the intuitive function is
represented by a certain attitude of expectation, a perceptive and penetrating vision, wherein only
the subsequent result can prove, in every case, how much was [p. 462] 'perceived-into', and how
much actually lay in the object.

Just as sensation, when given the priority, is not a mere reactive process of no further importance
for the object, but is almost an action which seizes and shapes the object, so it is with intuition,
which is by no means a mere perception, or awareness, but an active, creative process that builds
into the object just as much as it takes out. But, because this process extracts the perception
unconsciously, it also produces an unconscious effect in the object. The primary function of
intuition is to transmit mere images, or perceptions of relations and conditions, which could be
gained by the other functions, either not at all, or only by very roundabout ways. Such images
have the value of definite discernments, and have a decisive bearing upon action, whenever
intuition is given the chief weight; in which case, psychic adaptation is based almost exclusively

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

27

upon intuition. Thinking, feeling, and sensation are relatively repressed; of these, sensation is the
one principally affected, because, as the conscious function of sense, it offers the greatest
obstacle to intuition. Sensation disturbs intuition's clear, unbiassed, na[umlaut]ive awareness
with its importunate sensuous stimuli; for these direct the glance upon the physical superficies,
hence upon the very things round and beyond which intuition tries to peer. But since intuition, in
the extraverted attitude, has a prevailingly objective orientation, it actually comes very near to
sensation; indeed, the expectant attitude towards outer objects may, with almost equal
probability, avail itself of sensation. Hence, for intuition really to become paramount, sensation
must to a large extent be suppressed. I am now speaking of sensation as the simple and direct
sense-reaction, an almost definite physiological and psychic datum. This must be expressly
established beforehand, because, if I ask the intuitive how he is [p. 463] orientated, he will speak
of things which are quite indistinguishable from sense-perceptions. Frequently he will even make
use of the term 'sensation'. He actually has sensations, but he is not guided by them per se,
merely using them as directing-points for his distant vision. They are selected by unconscious
expectation. Not the strongest sensation, in the physiological sense, obtains the crucial value, but
any sensation whatsoever whose value happens to become considerably enhanced by reason of
the intuitive's unconscious attitude. In this way it may eventually attain the leading position,
appearing to the intuitive's consciousness indistinguishable from a pure sensation. But actually it
is not so.

Just as extraverted sensation strives to reach the highest pitch of actuality, because only thus can
the appearance of a complete life be created, so intuition tries to encompass the greatest
possibilities, since only through the awareness of possibilities is intuition fullysatisfied. Intuition
seeks to discover possibilities in the objective situation; hence as a mere tributary function (viz.
when not in the position of priority) it is also the instrument which, in the presence of a
hopelessly blocked situation, works automatically towards the issue, which no other function
could discover. Where intuition has the priority, every ordinary situation in life seems like a
closed room, which intuition has to open. It is constantly seeking outlets and fresh possibilities in
external life. In a very short time every actual situation becomes a prison to the intuitive; it
burdens him like a chain, prompting a compelling need for solution. At times objects would
seem to have an almost exaggerated value, should they chance to represent the idea of a
severance or release that might lead to the discovery of a new possibility. Yet no sooner have
they performed their office, serving intuition as a ladder or a bridge, than they [p. 464] appear to
have no further value, and are discarded as mere burdensome appendages. A fact is
acknowledged only in so far as it opens up fresh possibilities of advancing beyond it and of
releasing the individual from its operation. Emerging possibilities are compelling motives from
which intuition cannot escape and to which all else must be sacrificed.

9. The Extraverted Intuitive Type

Whenever intuition predominates, a particular and unmistakable psychology presents itself.
Because intuition is orientated by the object, a decided dependence upon external situations is
discernible, but it has an altogether different character from the dependence of the sensational
type. The intuitive is never to be found among the generally recognized reality values, but he is
always present where possibilities exist. He has a keen nose for things in the bud pregnant with
future promise. He can never exist in stable, long-established conditions of generally

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

28

acknowledged though limited value: because his eye is constantly ranging for new possibilities,
stable conditions have an air of impending suffocation. He seizes hold of new objects and new
ways with eager intensity, sometimes with extraordinary enthusiasm, only to abandon them cold-
bloodedly, without regard and apparently without remembrance, as soon as their range becomes
clearly defined and a promise of any considerable future development no longer clings to them.
As long as a possibility exists, the intuitive is bound to it with thongs of fate. It is as though his
whole life went out into the new situation. One gets the impression, which he himself shares, that
he has just reached the definitive turning point in his life, and that from now on nothing else can
seriously engage his thought and feeling. How- [p. 465] ever reasonable and opportune it may
be, and although every conceivable argument speaks in favour of stability, a day will come when
nothing will deter him from regarding as a prison, the self-same situation that seemed to promise
him freedom and deliverance, and from acting accordingly. Neither reason nor feeling can
restrain or discourage him from a new possibility, even though it may run counter to convictions
hitherto unquestioned. Thinking and feeling, the indispensable components of conviction, are,
with him, inferior functions, possessing no decisive weight; hence they lack the power to offer
any lasting. resistance to the force of intuition. And yet these are the only functions that are
capable of creating any effectual compensation to the supremacy of intuition, since they can
provide the intuitive with that judgment in which his type is altogether lacking. The morality of
the intuitive is governed neither by intellect nor by feeling; he has his own characteristic
morality, which consists in a loyalty to his intuitive view of things and a voluntary submission to
its authority, Consideration for the welfare of his neighbours is weak. No solid argument hinges
upon their well-being any more than upon his own. Neither can we detect in him any great
respect for his neighbour's convictions and customs; in fact, he is not infrequently put down as an
immoral and ruthless adventurer. Since his intuition is largely concerned with outer objects,
scenting out external possibilities, he readily applies himself to callings wherein he may expand
his abilities in many directions. Merchants, contractors, speculators, agents, politicians, etc.,
commonly belong to this type.

Apparently this type is more prone to favour women than men; in which case, however, the
intuitive activity reveals itself not so much in the professional as in the social sphere. Such
women understand the art of utilizing every social opportunity; they establish right social con-
[p. 466] nections; they seek out lovers with possibilities only to abandon everything again for the
sake of a new possibility.

It is at once clear, both from the standpoint of political economy and on grounds of general
culture, that such a type is uncommonly important. If well-intentioned, with an orientation to life
not purely egoistical, he may render exceptional service as the promoter, if not the initiator of
every kind of promising enterprise. He is the natural advocate of every minority that holds the
seed of future promise. Because of his capacity, when orientated more towards men than things,
to make an intuitive diagnosis of their abilities and range of usefulness, he can also 'make' men.
His capacity to inspire his fellow-men with courage, or to kindle enthusiasm for something new,
is unrivalled, although he may have forsworn it by the morrow. The more powerful and vivid his
intuition, the more is his subject fused and blended with the divined possibility. He animates it;
he presents it in plastic shape and with convincing fire; he almost embodies it. It is not a mere
histrionic display, but a fate.

This attitude has immense dangers -- all too easily the intuitive may squander his life. He spends
himself animating men and things, spreading around him an abundance of life -- a life, however,
which others live, not he. Were he able to rest with the actual thing, he would gather the fruit of
his labours; yet all too soon must he be running after some fresh possibility, quitting his newly
planted field, while others reap the harvest. In the end he goes empty away. But when the
intuitive lets things reach such a pitch, he also has the unconscious against him. The unconscious
of the intuitive has a certain similarity with that of the sensation-type. Thinking and feeling,
being relatively repressed, produce infantile and archaic thoughts and feelings in the
unconscious, which may be compared [p. 467] with those of the countertype. They likewise
come to the surface in the form of intensive projections, and are just as absurd as those of the
sensation-type, only to my mind they lack the other's mystical character; they are chiefly
concerned with quasi-actual things, in the nature of sexual, financial, and other hazards, as, for
instance, suspicions of approaching illness. This difference appears to be due to a repression of
the sensations of actual things. These latter usually command attention in the shape of a sudden
entanglement with a most unsuitable woman, or, in the case of a woman, with a thoroughly
unsuitable man; and this is simply the result of their unwitting contact with the sphere of archaic
sensations. But its consequence is an unconsciously compelling tie to an object of incontestable
futility. Such an event is already a compulsive symptom, which is also thoroughly characteristic
of this type. In common with the sensation-type, he claims a similar freedom and exemption
from all restraint, since he suffers no submission of his decisions to rational judgment, relying
entirely upon the perception of chance, possibilities. He rids himself of the restrictions of reason,
only to fall a victim to unconscious neurotic compulsions in the form of oversubtle, negative
reasoning, hair-splitting dialectics, and a compulsive tie to the sensation of the object. His
conscious attitude, both to the sensation and the sensed object, is one of sovereign superiority
and disregard. Not that he means to be inconsiderate or superior -- he simply does not see the
object that everyone else sees; his oblivion is similar to that of the sensation-type -- only, with
the latter, the soul of the object is missed. For this oblivion the object sooner or later takes
revenge in the form of hypochondriacal, compulsive ideas, phobias, and every imaginable kind
of absurd bodily sensation. [p. 468]

10. Recapitulation of Extraverted Irrational Types

I call the two preceding types irrational for reasons already referred to; namely, because their
commissions and omissions are based not upon reasoned judgment but upon the absolute
intensity of perception. Their perception is concerned with simple happenings, where no
selection has been exercised by the judgment. In this respect both the latter types have a
considerable superiority over the two judging types. The objective occurrence is both law-
determined and accidental. In so far as it is law-determined, it is accessible to reason; in so far as
it is accidental, it is not. One might reverse it and say that we apply the term law-determined to
the occurrence appearing so to our reason, and where its regularity escapes us we call it
accidental. The postulate of a universal lawfulness remains a postulate of reason only; in no
sense is it a postulate of our functions of perception. Since these are in no way grounded upon
the principle of reason and its postulates, they are, of their very nature, irrational. Hence my term
'irrational' corresponds with the nature of the perception-types. But merely because they
subordinate judgment to perception, it would be quite incorrect to regard these types as
unreasonable. They are merely in a high degree empirical; they are grounded exclusively upon

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

30

experience, so exclusively, in fact, that as a rule, their judgment cannot keep pace with their
experience. But the functions of judgment are none the less present, although they eke out a
largely unconscious existence. But, since the unconscious, in spite of its separation from the
conscious subject, is always reappearing on the scene, the actual life of the irrational types
exhibits striking judgments and acts of choice, which take the form of apparent sophistries, cold-
hearted criticisms, and an apparently purposeful [p. 469] selection of persons and situations.
These traits have a rather infantile, or even primitive, stamp; at times they are astonishingly
naive, but at times also inconsiderate, crude, or outrageous. To the rationally orientated mind, the
real character of such people might well appear rationalistic and purposeful in the bad sense. But
this judgment would be valid only for their unconscious, and, therefore, quite incorrect for their
conscious psychology, which is entirely orientated by perception, and because of its irrational
nature is quite unintelligible to the rational judgment. Finally, it may even appear to a rationally
orientated mind that such an assemblage of accidentals, hardly deserves the name 'psychology.'
The irrational type balances this contemptuous judgment with an equally poor impression of the
rational; for he sees him as something only half alive, whose only aim in life consists in fastening
the fetters of reason upon everything living, and wringing his own neck with criticisms.
Naturally, these are gross extremes; but they occur.

From the standpoint of the rational type, the irrational might easily be represented as a rational of
inferior quality; namely, when he is apprehended in the light of what happens to him. For what
happens to him is not the accidental-in that he is master-but, in its stead, he is overtaken by
rational judgment and rational aims. This fact is hardly comprehensible to the rational mind, but
its unthinkableness merely equals the astonishment of the irrational, when he discovers someone
who can set the ideas of reason above the living and actual event. Such a thing seems scarcely
credible to him. It is, as a rule, quite hopeless to look to him for any recognition of principles in
this direction, since a rational understanding is just as unknown and, in fact, tiresome to him as
the idea of making a contract, without mutual discussion and obligations, appears unthinkable to
the rational type. [p. 470]

This point brings me to the problem of the psychic relation between the representatives of the
different types. Following the terminology of the French school of hypnotists, the psychic
relation among the more modern psychiatrists is termed I 'rapport'. Rapport chiefly consists in a
feeling of actual accord, in spite of recognised differences. In fact, the recognition of existing
differences, in so far as they are common to both, is already a rapport, a feeling of accord. If we
make this feeling conscious to a rather high degree in an actual case, we discover that it has not
merely the quality of a feeling that cannot be analysed further, but it also has the nature of an
insight or cognitional content, representing the point of agreement in a conceptual form. This
rational presentation is exclusively valid for the rational types; it by no means applies to the
irrational, whose rapport is based not at all upon judgment but upon the parallelism of actual
living events. His feeling of accord is the common perception of a sensation or intuition. The
rational would say that rapport with the irrational depends purely upon chance. If, by some
accident, the objective situations are exactly in tune, something like a human relationship takes
place, but nobody can tell what will be either its validity or its duration. To the rational type it is
often a very bitter thought that the relationship will last only just so long as external
circumstances accidentally produce a mutual interest. This does not occur to him as being
especially human, whereas it is precisely in this situation that the irrational sees a humanity of

quite singular beauty. Accordingly each regards the other as a man destitute of relationships,
upon whom no reliance can be placed, and with whom one can never get on decent terms. Such a
result, however, is reached only when one consciously tries to make some estimate of the nature
of one's relationships with one's fellow-men. Although a psychological conscientiousness of [p.
471] this kind is by no means usual, yet it frequently happens that, notwithstanding an absolute
difference of standpoint, a kind of rapport does take place, and in the following way. The one
assumes with unspoken projection that the other is, in all essential points, of the same opinion as
himself, while the other divines or senses an objective community of interest, of which, however,
the former has no conscious inkling and whose existence he would at once dispute, just as it
would never occur to the latter that his relationship must rest upon a common point-of-view. A
rapport of this kind is by far the most frequent; it rests upon projection, which is the source of
many subsequent misunderstandings.

Psychic relationship, in the extraverted attitude, is always regulated by objective factors and
outer determinants. What a man is within has never any decisive significance. For our present-
day culture the extraverted attitude is the governing principle in the problem of human
relationship; naturally, the introverted principle occurs, but it is still the exception, and has to
appeal to the tolerance of the age.

C. THE INTROVERTED TYPE

(I) THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

As I have already explained in section A (1) of the present chapter, the introverted is
distinguished from the extraverted type by the fact that, unlike the latter, who is prevailingly
orientated by the object and objective data, he is governed by subjective factors. In the section
alluded to I mentioned, inter alia, that the introvert interposes a subjective view between the
perception of the object and his own action, which prevents the action from assuming a character
that corresponds with the objective situation. Naturally, this is a special case, mentioned by way
of [p. 472] example, and merely intended to serve as a simple illustration. But now we must go
in quest of more general formulations.

Introverted consciousness doubtless views the external conditions, but it selects the subjective
determinants as the decisive ones. The type is guided, therefore, by that factor of perception and
cognition which represents the receiving subjective disposition to the sense stimulus. Two
persons, for example, see the same object, but they never see it in such a way as to receive two
identically similar images of it. Quite apart from the differences in the personal equation and
mere organic acuteness, there often exists a radical difference, both in kind and degree, in the
psychic assimilation of the perceived image. Whereas the extraverted type refers pre-eminently
to that which reaches him from the object, the introvert principally relies upon that which the
outer impression constellates [sic] in the subject. In an individual case of apperception, the
difference may, of course, be very delicate, but in the total psychological economy it is
extremely noticeable, especially in the form of a reservation of the ego. Although it is
anticipating somewhat, I consider that point of view which inclines, with Weininger, to describe
this attitude as philautic, or with other writers, as autoerotic, egocentric, subjective, or egoistic, to
be both misleading in principle and definitely depreciatory. It corresponds with the normal bias

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

32

of the extraverted attitude against the nature of the introvert. We must not forget-although
extraverted opinion is only too prone to do so-that all perception and cognition is not purely
objective: it is also subjectively conditioned. The world exists not merely in itself, but also as it
appears to me. Indeed, at bottom, we have absolutely no criterion that could help us to form a
judgment of a world whose nature was unassimilable by the subject. If we were to ignore the
subjective factor, it [p. 473] would mean a complete denial of the great doubt as to the possibility
of absolute cognition. And this would mean a rechute into that stale and hollow positivism which
disfigured the beginning of our epoch -- an attitude of intellectual arrogance that is invariably
accompanied by a crudeness of feeling, and an essential violation of life, as stupid as it is
presumptuous. Through an overvaluation of the objective powers of cognition, we repress the
importance of the subjective factor, which simply means the denial of the subject. But what is the
subject? The subject is man -- we are the subject. Only a sick mind could forget that cognition
must have a subject, for there exists no knowledge and, therefore, for us, no world where 'I know'
has not been said, although with this statement one has already expressed the subjective
limitation of all knowledge.

The same holds good for all the psychic functions: they have a subject which is just as
indispensable as the object. It is characteristic of our present extraverted valuation that the word
'subjective' occasionally rings almost like a reproach or blemish; but in every case the epithet
'merely subjective' means a dangerous weapon of offence, destined for that daring head, that is
not unceasingly convinced of the unconditioned superiority of the object. We must, therefore, be
quite clear as to what meaning the term 'subjective' carries in this investigation. As the subjective
factor, then, I understand that psychological action or reaction which, when merged with the
effect of the object, makes a new psychic fact. Now, in so far as the subjective factor, since
oldest times and among all peoples, remains in a very large measure identical with itself -- since
elementary perceptions and cognitions are almost universally the same -- it is a reality that is just
as firmly established as the outer object. If this were not so, any sort of permanent and essentially
changeless reality [p. 474] would be altogether inconceivable, and any understanding with
posterity would be a matter of impossibility. Thus far, therefore, the subjective factor is
something that is just as much a fact as the extent of the sea and the radius of the earth. Thus far,
also, the subjective factor claims the whole value of a world-determining power which can never,
under any circumstances, be excluded from our calculations. It is the other world-law, and the
man who is based upon it has a foundation just as secure, permanent, and valid, as the man who
relies upon the object But, just as the object and objective data remain by no means always the
same, inasmuch as they are both perishable and subject to chance, the subjective factor is
similarly liable to variability and individual hazard. Hence its value is also merely relative. The
excessive development of the introverted standpoint in consciousness, for instance, does not lead
to a better or sounder application of the subjective factor, but to an artificial subjectification of
consciousness, which can hardly escape the reproach 'merely subjective'. For, as a
countertendency to this morbid subjectification, there ensues a desubjectification of
consciousness in the form of an exaggerated extraverted attitude which richly deserves
Weininger's description "misautic". Inasmuch as the introverted attitude is based upon a
universally present, extremely real, and absolutely indispensable condition of psychological
adaptation, such expressions as 'philautic', 'egocentric', and the like are both objectionable and
out of place, since they foster the prejudice that it is invariably a question of the beloved ego.
Nothing could be more absurd than such an assumption. Yet one is continually meeting it when

examining the judgments of the extravert upon the introvert. Not, of course, that I wish to ascribe
such an error to individual extraverts; it is rather the present generally accepted extraverted view
which is by no means restricted to the extraverted [p. 475] type; for it finds just as many
representatives in the ranks of the other type, albeit very much against its own interest. The
reproach of being untrue to his own kind is justly levelled at the latter, whereas, this, at least, can
never be charged against the former.

The introverted attitude is normally governed by the psychological structure, theoretically
determined by heredity, but which to the subject is an ever present subjective factor. This must
not be assumed, however, to be simply identical with the subject's ego, an assumption that is
certainly implied in the above mentioned designations of Weininger; it is rather the
psychological structure of the subject that precedes any development of the ego. The really
fundamental subject, the Self, is far more comprehensive than the ego, because the former also
embraces the unconscious, while the latter is essentially the focal point of consciousness. Were
the ego identical with the Self, it would be unthinkable that we should be able to appear in
dreams in entirely different forms and with entirely different meanings. But it is a characteristic
peculiarity of the introvert, which, moreover, is as much in keeping with his own inclination as
with the general bias, that he tends to confuse his ego with the Self, and to exalt his ego to the
position of subject of the psychological process, thus effecting that morbid subjectification of
consciousness, mentioned above, which so alienates him from the object.

The psychological structure is the same. Semon has termed it 'mneme',[2] whereas I call it the
'collective unconscious'. The individual Self is a portion, or excerpt, or representative, of
something universally present in all living creatures, and, therefore, a correspondingly graduated
kind of psychological process, which is born anew in every creature. Since earliest times, the
inborn manner of acting [p. 476] has been called instinct, and for this manner of psychic
apprehension of the object I have proposed the term archetype. I may assume that what is
understood by instinct is familiar to everyone. It is another matter with the archetype. This term
embraces the same idea as is contained in 'primordial image' (an expression borrowed from
Jakob Burckhardt), and as such I have described it in Chapter xi of this book. I must here refer
the reader to that chapter, in particular to the definition of 'image'.

The archetype is a symbolical formula, which always begins to function whenever there are no
conscious ideas present, or when such as are present are impossible upon intrinsic or extrinsic
grounds. The contents of the collective unconscious are represented in consciousness in the form
of pronounced tendencies, or definite ways of looking at things. They are generally regarded by
the individual as being determined by the object-incorrectly, at bottom-since they have their
source in the unconscious structure of the psyche, and are only released by the operation of the
object. These subjective tendencies and ideas are stronger than the objective influence; because
their psychic value is higher, they are superimposed upon all impressions. Thus, just as it seems
incomprehensible to the introvert that the object should always be decisive, it remains just as
enigmatic to the extravert how a subjective standpoint can be superior to the objective situation.
He reaches the unavoidable conclusion that the introvert is either a conceited egoist or a fantastic
doctrinaire. Recently he seems to have reached the conclusion that the introvert is constantly
influenced by an unconscious power-complex. The introvert unquestionably exposes himself to
this prejudice; for it cannot be denied that his definite and highly generalized mode of

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

34

expression, which apparently excludes every other view from the outset, lends a certain
countenance to [p. 477] this extraverted opinion. Furthermore, the very decisiveness and
inflexibility of the subjective judgment, which is superordinated to all objective data, is alone
sufficient to create the impression of a strong egocentricity. The introvert usually lacks the right
argument in presence of this prejudice; for he is just as unaware of the unconscious, though
thoroughly sound presuppositions of his subjective judgment, as he is of his subjective
perceptions. In harmony with the style of the times, he looks without, instead of behind his own
consciousness for the answer. Should he become neurotic, it is the sign of a more or less
complete unconscious identity of the ego with the Self, whereupon the importance of the Self is
reduced to nil, while the ego becomes inflated beyond reason. The undeniable, world-
determining power of the subjective factor then becomes concentrated in the ego, developing an
immoderate power claim and a downright foolish egocentricity. Every psychology which reduces
the nature of man to unconscious power instinct springs from this foundation. For example,
Nietzsche's many faults in taste owe their existence to this subjectification of consciousness.

(II) THE UNCONSCIOUS ATTITUDE

The superior position of the subjective factor in consciousness involves an inferiority of the
objective factor. The object is not given that importance which should really belong to it. Just as
it plays too great a role in the extraverted attitude, it has too little to say in the introverted. To the
extent that the introvert's consciousness is subjectified, thus bestowing undue importance upon
the ego, the object is placed in a position which in time becomes quite untenable. The object is a
factor of undeniable power, while the ego is something very restricted [p. 478] and transitory. It
would be a very different matter if the Self opposed the object. Self and world are
commensurable factors; hence a normal introverted attitude is just as valid, and has as good a
right to existence, as a normal extraverted attitude. But, if the ego has usurped the claims of the
subject, a compensation naturally develops under the guise of an unconscious reinforcement of
the influence of the object. Such a change eventually commands attention, for often, in spite of a
positively convulsive attempt to ensure the superiority of the ego, the object and objective data
develop an overwhelming influence, which is all the more invincible because it seizes upon the
individual unawares, thus effecting an irresistible invasion of consciousness. As a result of the
ego's defective relation to the object -- for a will to command is not adaptation -- a compensatory
relation to the object develops in the unconscious, which makes itself felt in consciousness as an
unconditional and irrepressible tie to the object. The more the ego seeks to secure every possible
liberty, independence, superiority, and freedom from obligations, the deeper does it fall into the
slavery of objective facts. The subject's freedom of mind is chained to an ignominious financial
dependence, his unconcernedness of action suffers now and again, a distressing collapse in the
face of public opinion, his moral superiority gets swamped in inferior relationships, and his
desire to dominate ends in a pitiful craving to be loved. The chief concern of the unconscious in
such a case is the relation to the object, and it affects this in a way that is calculated to bring both
the power illusion and the superiority phantasy to utter ruin. The object assumes terrifying
dimensions, in spite of conscious depreciation. Detachment from, and command of, the object
are, in consequence, pursued by the ego still more violently. Finally, the ego surrounds itself by a
regular system of safeguards (Adler has ably [p. 479] depicted these) which shall at least
preserve the illusion of superiority. But, therewith, the introvert severs himself completely from
the object, and either squanders his energy in defensive measures or makes fruitless attempts to

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

35

impose his power upon the object and successfully assert himself. But these efforts are
constantly being frustrated by the overwhelming impressions he receives from the object. It
continually imposes itself upon him against his will; it provokes in him the most disagreeable
and obstinate affects, persecuting him at every step. An immense, inner struggle is constantly
required of him, in order to 'keep going.' Hence Psychoasthenia is his typical form of neurosis, a
malady which is characterized on the one hand by an extreme sensitiveness, and on the other by
a great liability to exhaustion and chronic fatigue.

An analysis of the personal unconscious yields an abundance of power phantasies coupled with
fear of the dangerously animated objects, to which, as a matter of fact, the introvert easily falls a
victim. For a peculiar cowardliness develops from this fear of the object; he shrinks from making
either himself or his opinion effective, always dreading an intensified influence on the part of the
object. He is terrified of impressive affects in others, and is hardly ever free from the dread of
falling under hostile influence. For objects possess terrifying and powerful qualities for him-
qualities which he cannot consciously discern in them, but which, through his unconscious
perception, he cannot choose but believe in. Since his conscious relation to the object is
relatively repressed, its exit is by way of the unconscious, where it becomes loaded with the
qualities of the unconscious. These qualities are primarily infantile and archaic. His relation to
the object, therefore, becomes correspondingly primitive, taking on all those peculiarities which
characterize the primitive objectrelationship. Now it seems as though objects possessed [p. 480]
magical powers. Strange, new objects excite fear and distrust, as though concealing unknown
dangers; objects long rooted and blessed by tradition are attached to his soul as by invisible
threads; every change has a disturbing, if not actually dangerous aspect, since its apparent
implication is a magical animation of the object. A lonely island where only what is permitted to
move moves, becomes an ideal. Auch Einer, the novel by F. Th. Vischer, gives a rich insight into
this side of the introvert's psychology, and at the same time shows the underlying symbolism of
the collective unconscious, which in this description of types I am leaving on one side, since it is
a universal phenomenon with no especial connection with types.

(III) PECULIARITIES OF THE BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN THE
INTROVERTED ATTITUDE

1. Thinking

When describing extraverted thinking, I gave a brief characterization of introverted thinking, to
which at this stage I must make further reference. Introverted thinking is primarily orientated by
the subjective factor. At the least, this subjective factor is represented by a subjective feeling of
direction, which, in the last resort, determines judgment. Occasionally, it is a more or less
finished image, which to some extent, serves as a standard. This thinking may be conceived
either with concrete or with abstract factors, but always at the decisive points it is orientated by
subjective data. Hence, it does not lead from concrete experience back again into objective
things, but always to the subjective content, External facts are not the aim and origin of this
thinking, although the introvert would often like to make it so appear. It begins in the subject,
and returns to the subject, although it may [p. 481] undertake the widest flights into the territory
of the real and the actual. Hence, in the statement of new facts, its chief value is indirect, because
new views rather than the perception of new facts are its main concern. It formulates questions

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

36

and creates theories; it opens up prospects and yields insight, but in the presence of facts it
exhibits a reserved demeanour. As illustrative examples they have their value, but they must not
prevail. Facts are collected as evidence or examples for a theory, but never for their own sake.
Should this latter ever occur, it is done only as a compliment to the extraverted style. For this
kind of thinking facts are of secondary importance; what, apparently, is of absolutely paramount
importance is the development and presentation of the subjective idea, that primordial
symbolical image standing more or less darkly before the inner vision. Its aim, therefore, is never
concerned with an intellectual reconstruction of concrete actuality, but with the shaping of that
dim image into a resplendent idea. Its desire is to reach reality; its goal is to see how external
facts fit into, and fulfil, the framework of the idea; its actual creative power is proved by the fact
that this thinking can also create that idea which, though not present in the external facts, is yet
the most suitable, abstract expression of them. Its task is accomplished when the idea it has
fashioned seems to emerge so inevitably from the external facts that they actually prove its
validity.

But just as little as it is given to extraverted thinking to wrest a really sound inductive idea from
concrete facts or ever to create new ones, does it lie in the power of introverted thinking to
translate its original image into an idea adequately adapted to the facts. For, as in the former case
the purely empirical heaping together of facts paralyses thought and smothers their meaning, so
in the latter case introverted thinking shows a dangerous tendency [p. 482] to coerce facts into
the shape of its image, or by ignoring them altogether, to unfold its phantasy image in freedom.
In such a case, it will be impossible for the presented idea to deny its origin from the dim archaic
image. There will cling to it a certain mythological character that we are prone to interpret as
'originality', or in more pronounced cases' as mere whimsicality; since its archaic character is not
transparent as such to specialists unfamiliar with mythological motives. The subjective force of
conviction inherent in such an idea is usually very great; its power too is the more convincing,
the less it is influenced by contact with outer facts. Although to the man who advocates the idea,
it may well seem that his scanty store of facts were the actual ground and source of the truth and
validity of his idea, yet such is not the case, for the idea derives its convincing power from its
unconscious archetype, which, as such, has universal validity and everlasting truth. Its truth,
however, is so universal and symbolic, that it must first enter into the recognized and
recognizable knowledge of the time, before it can become a practical truth of any real value to
life. What sort of a causality would it be, for instance, that never became perceptible in practical
causes and practical results?

This thinking easily loses itself in the immense truth of the subjective factor. It creates theories
for the sake of theories, apparently with a view to real or at least possible facts, yet always with a
distinct tendency to go over from the world of ideas into mere imagery. Accordingly many
intuitions of possibilities appear on the scene, none of which however achieve any reality, until
finally images are produced which no longer express anything externally real, being 'merely'
symbols of the simply unknowable. It is now merely a mystical thinking and quite as unfruitful
as that empirical thinking whose sole operation is within the framework of objective facts. [p.
483]

Whereas the latter sinks to the level of a mere presentation of facts, the former evaporates into a
representation of the unknowable, which is even beyond everything that could be expressed in an

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

37

image. The presentation of facts has a certain incontestable truth, because the subjective factor is
excluded and the facts speak for themselves. Similarly, the representing of the unknowable has
also an immediate, subjective, and convincing power, because it is demonstrable from its own
existence. The former says 'Est, ergo est' ('It is ; therefore it is') ; while the latter says 'Cogito,
ergo cogito' (' I think ; therefore I think'). In the last analysis, introverted thinking arrives at the
evidence of its own subjective being, while extraverted thinking is driven to the evidence of its
complete identity with the objective fact. For, while the extravert really denies himself in his
complete dispersion among objects, the introvert, by ridding himself of each and every content,
has to content himself with his mere existence. In both cases the further development of life is
crowded out of the domain of thought into the region of other psychic functions which had
hitherto existed in relative unconsciousness. The extraordinary impoverishment of introverted
thinking in relation to objective facts finds compensation in an abundance of unconscious facts.
Whenever consciousness, wedded to the function of thought, confines itself within the smallest
and emptiest circle possible -- though seeming to contain the plenitude of divinity -- unconscious
phantasy becomes proportionately enriched by a multitude of archaically formed facts, a
veritable pandemonium of magical and irrational factors, wearing the particular aspect that
accords with the nature of that function which shall next relieve the thought-function as the
representative of life. If this should be the intuitive function, the 'other side' will be viewed with
the eyes of a Kubin or a Meyrink. If it is the feeling-function, [p. 484] there arise quite unheard
of and fantastic feeling-relations, coupled with feeling-judgments of a quite contradictory and
unintelligible character. If the sensation-function, then the senses discover some new and never-
before-experienced possibility, both within and without the body. A closer investigation of such
changes can easily demonstrate the reappearance of primitive psychology with all its
characteristic features. Naturally, the thing experienced is not merely primitive but also
symbolic; in fact, the older and more primeval it appears, the more does it represent the future
truth: since everything ancient in our unconscious means the coming possibility.

Under ordinary circumstances, not even the transition to the 'other side' succeeds -- still less the
redeeming journey through the unconscious. The passage across is chiefly prevented by
conscious resistance to any subjection of the ego to the unconscious reality and to the
determining reality of the unconscious object. The condition is a dissociation-in other words, a
neurosis having the character of an inner wastage with increasing brain-exhaustion -- a
psychoasthenia, in fact.

2. The Introverted Thinking Type

Just as Darwin might possibly represent the normal extraverted thinking type, so we might point
to Kant as a counter-example of the normal introverted thinking type. The former speaks with
facts; the latter appeals to the subjective factor. Darwin ranges over the wide fields of objective
facts, while Kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge in general. But suppose a Cuvier be
contrasted with a Nietzsche: the antithesis becomes even sharper.

The introverted thinking type is characterized by a priority of the thinking I have just described.
Like his [p. 485] extraverted parallel, he is decisively influenced by ideas; these, however, have
their origin, not in the objective data but in the subjective foundation. Like the extravert, he too
will follow his ideas, but in the reverse direction: inwardly not outwardly. Intensity is his aim,

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

38

not extensity. In these fundamental characters he differs markedly, indeed quite unmistakably
from his extraverted parallel. Like every introverted type, he is almost completely lacking in that
which distinguishes his counter type, namely, the intensive relatedness to the object. In the case
of a human object, the man has a distinct feeling that he matters only in a negative way, i.e., in
milder instances he is merely conscious of being superfluous, but with a more extreme type he
feels himself warded off as something definitely disturbing. This negative relation to the object-
indifference, and even aversion-characterizes every introvert; it also makes a description of the
introverted type in general extremely difficult. With him, everything tends to disappear and get
concealed. His judgment appears cold, obstinate, arbitrary, and inconsiderate, simply because he
is related less to the object than the subject. One can feel nothing in it that might possibly confer
a higher value upon the object; it always seems to go beyond the object, leaving behind it a
flavour of a certain subjective superiority. Courtesy, amiability, and friendliness may be present,
but often with a particular quality suggesting a certain uneasiness, which betrays an ulterior aim,
namely, the disarming of an opponent, who must at all costs be pacified and set at ease lest he
prove a disturbing- element. In no sense, of course, is he an opponent, but, if at all sensitive, he
will feel somewhat repelled, perhaps even depreciated. Invariably the object has to submit to a
certain neglect; in worse cases it is even surrounded with quite unnecessary measures of
precaution. Thus it happens that this type tends to [p. 486]

disappear behind a cloud of misunderstanding, which only thickens the more he attempts to
assume, by way of compensation and with the help of his inferior functions, a certain mask of
urbanity, which often presents a most vivid contrast to his real nature. Although in the extension
of his world of ideas he shrinks from no risk, however daring, and never even considers the
possibility that such a world might also be dangerous, revolutionary, heretical, and wounding to
feeling, he is none the less a prey to the liveliest anxiety, should it ever chance to become
objectively real. That goes against the grain. When the time comes for him to transplant his ideas
into the world, his is by no means the air of an anxious mother solicitous for her children's
welfare; he merely exposes them, and is often extremely annoyed when they fail to thrive on
their own account. The decided lack he usually displays in practical ability, and his aversion
from any sort of re[accent]clame assist in this attitude. If to his eyes his product appears
subjectively correct and true, it must also be so in practice, and others have simply got to bow to
its truth. Hardly ever will he go out of his way to win anyone's appreciation of it, especially if it
be anyone of influence. And, when he brings himself to do so, he is usually so extremely
maladroit that he merely achieves the opposite of his purpose. In his own special province, there
are usually awkward experiences with his colleagues, since he never knows how to win their
favour; as a rule he only succeeds in showing them how entirely superfluous they are to him. In
the pursuit of his ideas he is generally stubborn, head-strong, and quite unamenable to influence.
His suggestibility to personal influences is in strange contrast to this. An object has only to be
recognized as apparently innocuous for such a type to become extremely accessible to really
inferior elements. They lay hold of him from the [p. 487] unconscious. He lets himself be
brutalized and exploited in the most ignominious way, if only he can be left undisturbed in the
pursuit of his ideas. He simply does not see when he is being plundered behind his back and
wronged in practical ways: this is because his relation to the object is such a secondary matter
that lie is left without a guide in the purely objective valuation of his product. In thinking out his
problems to the utmost of his ability, he also complicates them, and constantly becomes
entangled in every possible scruple. However clear to himself the inner structure of his thoughts

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

39

may be, he is not in the least clear where and how they link up with the world of reality. Only
with difficulty can he persuade himself to admit that what is clear to him may not be equally
clear to everyone. His style is usually loaded and complicated by all sorts of accessories,
qualifications, saving clauses, doubts, etc., which spring from his exacting scrupulousness. His
work goes slowly and with difficulty. Either he is taciturn or he falls among people who cannot
understand him; whereupon he proceeds to gather further proof of the unfathomable stupidity of
man. If he should ever chance to be understood, he is credulously liable to overestimate.
Ambitious women have only to understand how advantage may be taken of his uncritical attitude
towards the object to make an easy prey of him; or he may develop into a misanthropic bachelor
with a childlike heart. Then, too, his outward appearance is often gauche, as if he were painfully
anxious to escape observation; or he may show a remarkable unconcern, an almost childlike
naivete. In his own particular field of work he provokes violent contradiction, with which he has
no notion how to deal, unless by chance he is seduced by his primitive affects into biting and
fruitless polemics. By his wider circle he is counted inconsiderate and domineering. But the [p.
488] better one knows him, the more favourable one's judgment becomes, and his nearest friends
are well aware how to value his intimacy. To people who judge him from afar he appears
prickly, inaccessible, haughty; frequently he may even seem soured as a result of his anti-social
prejudices. He has little influence as a personal teacher, since the mentality of his pupils is
strange to him. Besides, teaching has, at bottom, little interest for him, except when it
accidentally provides him with a theoretical problem. He is a poor teacher, because while
teaching his thought is engaged with the actual material, and will not be satisfied with its mere
presentation.

With the intensification of his type, his convictions become all the more rigid and unbending.
Foreign influences are eliminated; he becomes more unsympathetic to his peripheral world, and
therefore more dependent upon his intimates. His expression becomes more personal and
inconsiderate and his ideas more profound, but they can no longer be adequately expressed in the
material at hand. This lack is replaced by emotivity and susceptibility. The foreign influence,
brusquely declined from without, reaches him from within, from the side of the unconscious, and
he is obliged to collect evidence against it and against things in general which to outsiders seems
quite superfluous. Through the subjectification of consciousness occasioned by his defective
relationship to the object, what secretly concerns his own person now seems to him of chief
importance. And he begins to confound his subjective truth with his own person. Not that he will
attempt to press anyone personally with his convictions, but he will break out with venomous
and personal retorts against every criticism, however just. Thus in every respect his isolation
gradually increases. His originally fertilizing ideas become destructive, because poisoned by a
kind of sediment of bitterness. His struggle against the influences emanating [p. 489] from the
unconscious increases with his external isolation, until gradually this begins to cripple him. A
still greater isolation must surely protect him from the unconscious influences, but as a rule this
only takes him deeper into the conflict which is destroying him within.

The thinking of the introverted type is positive and synthetic in the development of those ideas
which in ever increasing measure approach the eternal validity of the primordial images. But,
when their connection with objective experience begins to fade, they become mythological and
untrue for the present situation. Hence this thinking holds value only for its contemporaries, just
so long as it also stands in visible and understandable connection with the known facts of the

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

40

time. But, when thinking becomes mythological, its irrelevancy grows until finally it gets lost in
itself. The relatively unconscious functions of feeling, intuition, and sensation, which
counterbalance introverted thinking, are inferior in quality and have a primitive, extraverted
character, to which all the troublesome objective influences this type is subject to must be
ascribed. The various measures of self-defence, the curious protective obstacles with which such
people are wont to surround themselves, are sufficiently familiar, and I may, therefore, spare
myself a description of them. They all serve as a defence against 'magical' influences; a vague
dread of the other sex also belongs to this category.

3. Feeling

Introverted feeling is determined principally by the subjective factor. This means that the feeling-
judgment differs quite as essentially from extraverted feeling as does the introversion of thinking
from extraversion. It is unquestionably difficult to give an intellectual presentation of the
introverted feeling process, or even an approximate [p. 490] description of it, although the
peculiar character of this kind of feeling simply stands out as soon as one becomes aware of it at
all. Since it is primarily controlled by subjective preconditions, and is only secondarily
concerned with the object, this feeling appears much less upon the surface and is, as a rule,
misunderstood. It is a feeling which apparently depreciates the object; hence it usually becomes
noticeable in its negative manifestations. The existence of a positive feeling can be inferred only
indirectly, as it were. Its aim is not so much to accommodate to the objective fact as to stand
above it, since its whole unconscious effort is to give reality to the underlying images. It is, as it
were, continually seeking an image which has no existence in reality, but of which it has had a
sort of previous vision. From objects that can never fit in with its aim it seems to glide
unheedingly away. It strives after an inner intensity, to which at the most, objects contribute only
an accessory stimulus. The depths of this feeling can only be divined -- they can never be clearly
comprehended. It makes men silent and difficult of access; with the sensitiveness of the mimosa,
it shrinks from the brutality of the object, in order to expand into the depths of the subject. It puts
forward negative feeling-judgments or assumes an air of profound indifference, as a measure of
self-defence.

Primordial images are, of course, just as much idea as feeling. Thus, basic ideas such as God,
freedom, immortality are just as much feeling-values as they are significant as ideas. Everything,
therefore, that has been said of the introverted thinking refers equally to introverted feeling, only
here everything is felt while there it was thought. But the fact that thoughts can generally be
expressed more intelligibly than feelings demands a more than ordinary descriptive or artistic
capacity before the real wealth of this feeling can be even approximately [p. 491] presented or
communicated to the outer world. Whereas subjective thinking, on account of its unrelatedness,
finds great difficulty in arousing an adequate understanding, the same, though in perhaps even
higher degree, holds good for subjective feeling. In order to communicate with others it has to
find an external form which is not only fitted to absorb the subjective feeling in a satisfying
expression, but which must also convey it to one's fellowman in such a way that a parallel
process takes place in him. Thanks to the relatively great internal (as well as external) similarity
of the human being, this effect can actually be achieved, although a form acceptable to feeling is
extremely difficult to find, so long as it is still mainly orientated by the fathomless store of
primordial images. But, when it becomes falsified by an egocentric attitude, it at once grows

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

41

unsympathetic, since then its major concern is still with the ego. Such a case never fails to create
an impression of sentimental self-love, with its constant effort to arouse interest and even morbid
self-admiration just as the subjectified consciousness of the introverted thinker, striving after an
abstraction of abstractions, only attains a supreme intensity of a thought-process in itself quite
empty, so the intensification of egocentric feeling only leads to a contentless passionateness,
which merely feels itself. This is the mystical, ecstatic stage, which prepares the way over into
the extraverted functions repressed by feeling, just as introverted thinking is pitted against a
primitive feeling, to which objects attach themselves with magical force, so introverted feeling is
counterbalanced by a primitive thinking, whose concretism and slavery to facts passes all
bounds. Continually emancipating itself from the relation to the object, this feeling creates a
freedom, both of action and of conscience, that is only answerable to the subject, and that may
even renounce all traditional values. But so much the more [p. 492] does unconscious thinking
fall a victim to the power of objective facts.

4. The Introverted Feeling Type

It is principally among women that I have found the priority of introverted feeling. The proverb
'Still waters run deep' is very true of such women. They are mostly silent, inaccessible, and hard
to understand; often they hide behind a childish or banal mask, and not infrequently their
temperament is melancholic. They neither shine nor reveal themselves. Since they submit the
control of their lives to their subjectively orientated feeling, their true motives generally remain
concealed. Their outward demeanour is harmonious and inconspicuous; they reveal a delightful
repose, a sympathetic parallelism, which has no desire to affect others, either to impress,
influence, or change them in any way. Should this outer side be somewhat emphasized, a
suspicion of neglectfulness and coldness may easily obtrude itself, which not seldom increases to
a real indifference for the comfort and well-being of others. One distinctly feels the movement of
feeling away from the object. With the normal type, however, such an event only occurs when
the object has in some way too strong an effect. The harmonious feeling atmosphere rules only
so long as the object moves upon its own way with a moderate feeling intensity, and makes no
attempt to cross the other's path. There is little effort to accompany the real emotions of the
object, which tend to be damped and rebuffed, or to put it more aptly, are 'cooled off' by a
negative feeling-judgment. Although one may find a constant readiness for a peaceful and
harmonious companionship, the unfamiliar object is shown no touch of amiability, no gleam of
responding warmth, but is met by a manner of apparent indifference or repelling coldness. [p.
493]

One may even be made to feel the superfluousness of one's own existence. In the presence of
something that might carry one away or arouse enthusiasm, this type observes a benevolent
neutrality, tempered with an occasional trace of superiority and criticism that soon takes the wind
out of the sails of a sensitive object. But a stormy emotion will be brusquely rejected with
murderous coldness, unless it happens to catch the subject from the side of the unconscious, i.e.
unless, through the animation of some primordial image, feeling is, as it were, taken captive. In
which event such a woman simply feels a momentary laming, invariably producing, in due
course, a still more violent resistance, which reaches the object in his most vulnerable spot. The
relation to the object is, as far as possible, kept in a secure and tranquil middle state of feeling,
where passion and its intemperateness are resolutely proscribed. Expression of feeling, therefore,

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

42

remains niggardly and, when once aware of it at all, the object has a permanent sense of his
undervaluation. Such, however, is not always the case, since very often the deficit remains
unconscious; whereupon the unconscious feeling-claims gradually produce symptoms which
compel a more serious attention.

A superficial judgment might well be betrayed, by a rather cold and reserved demeanour, into
denying all feeling to this type. Such a view, however, would be quite false; the truth is, her
feelings are intensive rather than extensive. They develop into the depth. Whereas, for instance,
an extensive feeling of sympathy can express itself in both word and deed at the right place, thus
quickly ridding itself of its impression, an intensive sympathy, because shut off from every
means of expression, gains a passionate depth that embraces the misery of a world and is simply
benumbed. It may possibly make an extravagant irruption, leading to some staggering act of an
almost heroic character, to which, however, neither the object nor [p. 494] the subject can find a
right relation. To the outer world, or to the blind eyes of the extravert, this sympathy looks like
coldness, for it does nothing visibly, and an extraverted consciousness is unable to believe in
invisible forces.

Such misunderstanding is a characteristic occurrence in the life of this type, and is commonly
registered as a most weighty argument against any deeper feeling relation with the object. But
the underlying, real object of this feeling is only dimly divined by the normal type. It may
possibly express its aim and content in a concealed religiosity anxiously shielded, from profane
eyes, or in intimate poetic forms equally safeguarded from surprise; not without a secret
ambition to bring about some superiority over the object by such means. Women often express
much of it in their children, letting their passionateness flow secretly into them.

Although in the normal type, the tendency, above alluded to, to overpower or coerce the object
once openly and visibly with the thing secretly felt, rarely plays a disturbing role, and never leads
to a serious attempt in this direction, some trace of it, none the less, leaks through into the
personal effect upon the object, in the form of a domineering influence often difficult to define. It
is sensed as a sort of stifling or oppressive feeling which holds the immediate circle under a
spell. It gives a woman of this type a certain mysterious power that may prove terribly
fascinating to the extraverted man, for it touches his unconscious. This power is derived from the
deeply felt, unconscious images; consciousness, however, readily refers it to the ego, whereupon
the influence becomes debased into personal tyranny. But, wherever the unconscious subject is
identified with the ego, the mysterious power of the intensive feeling is also transformed into
banal and arrogant ambition, vanity, and [p. 495] petty tyranny. This produces a type of woman
most regrettably distinguished by her unscrupulous ambition and mischievous cruelty. But this
change in the picture leads also to neurosis.

So long as the ego feels itself housed, as it were, beneath the heights of the unconscious subject,
and feeling reveals something higher and mightier than the ego, the type is normal. The
unconscious thinking is certainly archaic, yet its reductions may prove extremely helpful in
compensating the occasional inclinations to exalt the ego into the subject. But, whenever this
does take place by dint of complete suppression of the unconscious reductive thinking-products,
the unconscious thinking goes over into opposition and becomes projected into objects.
Whereupon the now egocentric subject comes to feel the power and importance of the

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

43

depreciated object. Consciousness begins to feel 'what others think'. Naturally, others are
thinking, all sorts of baseness, scheming evil, and contriving all sorts of plots, secret intrigues,
etc. To prevent this, the subject must also begin to carry out preventive intrigues, to suspect and
sound others, to make subtle combinations. Assailed by rumours, he must make convulsive
efforts to convert, if possible, a threatened inferiority into a superiority. Innumerable secret
rivalries develop, and in these embittered struggles not only will no base or evil means be
disdained, but even virtues will be misused and tampered with in order to play the trump card.
Such a development must lead to exhaustion. The form of neurosis is neurasthenic rather than
hysterical; in the case of women we often find severe collateral physical states, as for instance
anæmia and its sequelæ.

5. Recapitulation of Introverted Rational Types

Both the foregoing types are rational, since they are founded upon reasoning, judging functions.
Reasoning [p. 496] judgment is based not merely upon objective, but also upon subjective, data.
But the predominance of one or other factor, conditioned by a psychic disposition often existing
from early youth, deflects the reasoning function. For a judgment to be really reasonable it
should have equal reference to both the objective and the subjective factors, and be able to do
justice to both. This, however, would be an ideal case, and would presuppose a uniform
development of both extraversion and introversion. But either movement excludes the other, and,
so long as this dilemma persists, they cannot possibly exist side by, side, but at the most
successively. Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, an ideal reason is impossible. A rational
type has always a typical reasonal variation. Thus, the introverted rational types unquestionably
have a reasoning judgment, only it is a judgment whose leading note is subjective. The laws of
logic are not necessarily deflected, since its onesidedness lies in the premise. The premise is the
predominance of the subjective factor existing beneath every conclusion and colouring every
judgment. Its superior value as compared with the objective factor is self-evident from the
beginning. As already stated, it is not just a question of value bestowed, but of a natural
disposition existing before all rational valuation. Hence, to the introvert rational judgment
necessarily appears to have many nuances which differentiate it from that of the extravert. Thus,
to the introvert, to mention the most general instance, that chain of reasoning which leads to the
subjective factor appears rather more reasonable than that which leads to the object. This
difference, which in the individual case is practically insignificant, indeed almost unnoticeable,
effects unbridgeable oppositions in the gross; these are the more irritating, the less we are aware
of the minimal standpoint displacement produced by the psychological premise in the individual
case. A [p. 497] capital error regularly creeps in here, for one labours to prove a fallacy in the
conclusion, instead of realizing the difference of the psychological premise. Such a realization is
a difficult matter for every rational type, since it undermines the apparent, absolute validity of his
own principle, and delivers him over to its antithesis, which certainly amounts to a catastrophe.

Almost more even than the extraverted is the introverted type subject to misunderstanding: not so
much because the extravert is a more merciless or critical adversary, than he himself can easily
be, but because the style of the epoch in which he himself participates is against him. Not in
relation to the extraverted type, but as against our general accidental world-philosophy, he finds
himself in the minority, not of course numerically, but from the evidence of his own feeling. In
so far as he is a convinced participator in the general style, he undermines his own foundations,

Get any book for free on:   www.Abika.com

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

44

since the present style, with its almost exclusive acknowledgment of the visible and the tangible,
is opposed to his principle. Because of its invisibility, he is obliged to depreciate the subjective
factor, and to force himself to join in the extraverted overvaluation of the object. He himself sets
the subjective factor at too low a value, and his feelings of inferiority are his chastisement for
this sin. Little wonder, therefore, that it is precisely our epoch, and particularly those movements
which are somewhat ahead of the time, that reveal the subjective factor in every kind of
exaggerated, crude and grotesque form of expression. I refer to the art of the present day.

The undervaluation of his own principle makes the introvert egotistical, and forces upon him the
psychology of the oppressed. The more egotistical he becomes, the stronger his impression
grows that these others, who are apparently able, without qualms, to conform with the present
style, are the oppressors against whom he must guard and [p. 498] protect himself. He does not
usually perceive that he commits his capital mistake in not depending upon the subjective factor
with that same loyalty and devotion with which the extravert follows the object By the
undervaluation of his own principle, his penchant towards egoism becomes unavoidable, which,
of course, richly deserves the prejudice of the extravert. Were he only to remain true to his own
principle, the judment of 'egoist' would be radically false; for the justification of his attitude
would be established by its general efficacy, and all misunderstandings dissipated.

6. Sensation

Sensation, which in obedience to its whole nature is concerned with the object and the objective
stimulus, also undergoes a considerable modification in the introverted attitude. It, too, has a
subjective factor, for beside the object sensed there stands a sensing subject, who contributes his
subjective disposition to the objective stimulus. In the introverted attitude sensation is definitely
based upon the subjective portion of perception. What is meant by this finds its best illustration
in the reproduction of objects in art. When, for instance, several painters undertake to paint one
and the same landscape, with a sincere attempt to reproduce it faithfully, each painting will none
the less differ from the rest, not merely by virtue of a more or less developed ability, but chiefly
because of a different vision; there will even appear in some of the paintings a decided psychic
variation, both in general mood and in treatment of colour and form. Such qualities betray a more
or less influential co-operation of the subjective factor. The subjective factor of sensation is
essentially the same as in the other functions already spoken of. It is an unconscious disposition,
which alters [p. 499] the sense-perception at its very source, thus depriving it of the character of
a purely objective influence. In this case, sensation is related primarily to the subject, and only
secondarily to the object. How extraordinarily strong the subjective factor can be is shown most
clearly in art. The ascendancy of the subjective factor occasionally achieves a complete
suppression of the mere influence of the object; but none the less sensation remains sensation,
although it has come to be a perception of the subjective factor, and the effect of the object has
sunk to the level of a mere stimulant. Introverted sensation develops in accordance with this
subjective direction. A true sense-perception certainly exists, but it always looks as though
objects were not so much forcing their way into the subject in their own right as that the subject
were seeing things quite differently, or saw quite other things than the rest of mankind. As a
matter of fact, the subject perceives the same things as everybody else, only, he never stops at the
purely objective effect, but concerns himself with the subjective perception released by the
objective stimulus. Subjective perception differs remarkably from the objective. It is either not

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

45

found at all in the object, or, at most, merely suggested by it; it can, however, be similar to the
sensation of other men, although not immediately derived from the objective behaviour of things.
It does not impress one as a mere product of consciousness -- it is too genuine for that. But it
makes a definite psychic impression, since elements of a higher psychic order are perceptible to
it. This order, however, does not coincide with the contents of consciousness. It is concerned
with presuppositions, or dispositions of the collective unconscious, with mythological images,
with primal possibilities of ideas. The character of significance and meaning clings to subjective
perception. It says more than the mere image of the object, though naturally only to him for
whom the [p. 500] subjective factor has some meaning. To another, a reproduced subjective
impression seems to suffer from the defect of possessing insufficient similarity with the object; it
seems, therefore, to have failed in its purpose. Subjective sensation apprehends the background
of the physical world rather than its surface. The decisive thing is not the reality of the object, but
the reality of the subjective factor, i.e. the primordial images, which in their totality represent a
psychic mirror-world. It is a mirror, however, with the peculiar capacity of representing the
present contents of consciousness not in their known and customary form but in a certain sense
sub specie aeternitatis, somewhat as a million-year old consciousness might see them. Such a
consciousness would see the becoming and the passing of things beside their present and
momentary existence, and not only that, but at the same time it would also see that Other, which
was before their becoming and will be after their passing hence. To this consciousness the
present moment is improbable. This is, of course, only a simile, of which, however, I had need to
give some sort of illustration of the peculiar nature of introverted sensation. Introverted sensation
conveys an image whose effect is not so much to reproduce the object as to throw over it a
wrapping whose lustre is derived from age-old subjective experience and the still unborn future
event. Thus, mere sense impression develops into the depth of the meaningful, while extraverted
sensation seizes only the momentary and manifest existence of things.

7. The Introverted Sensation Type

The priority of introverted sensation produces a definite type, which is characterized by certain
peculiarities. It is an irrational type, inasmuch as its selection among occurrences is not primarily
rational, but is guided rather [p. 501] by what just happens. Whereas, the extraverted sensation-
type is determined by the intensity of the objective influence, the introverted type is orientated by
the intensity of the subjective sensation-constituent released by the objective stimulus.
Obviously, therefore, no sort of proportional relation exists between object and sensation, but
something that is apparently quite irregular and arbitrary judging from without, therefore, it is
practically impossible to foretell what will make an impression and what will not. If there were
present a capacity and readiness for expression in any way commensurate with the strength of
sensation, the irrationality of this type would be extremely evident. This is the case, for instance,
when the individual is a creative artist. But, since this is the exception, it usually happens that the
characteristic introverted difficulty of expression also conceals his irrationality. On the contrary,
he may actually stand out by the very calmness and passivity of his demeanour, or by his rational
self-control. This peculiarity, which often leads the superficial judgment astray, is really due to
his unrelatedness to objects. Normally the object is not consciously depreciated in the least, but
its stimulus is removed from it, because it is immediately replaced by a subjective reaction,
which is no longer related to the reality of the object. This, of course, has the same effect as a

or why objects in general should have any right to existence, since everything essential happens
without the object. This doubt may be justified in extreme cases, though not in the normal, since
the objective stimulus is indispensable to his sensation, only it produces something different
from what was to be surmised from the external state of affairs. Considered from without, it
looks as though the effect of the object [p. 502] did not obtrude itself upon the subject. This
impression is so far correct inasmuch as a subjective content does, in fact, intervene from the
unconscious, thus snatching away the effect of the object. This intervention may be so abrupt
that the individual appears to shield himself directly from any possible influence of the object. In
any aggravated or well-marked case, such a protective guard is also actually present. Even with
only a slight reinforcement of the unconscious, the subjective constituent of sensation becomes
so alive that it almost completely obscures the objective influence. The results of this are, on the
one hand, a feeling of complete depreciation on the part of the object, and, on the other, an
illusory conception of reality on the part of the subject, which in morbid cases may even reach
the point of a complete inability to discriminate between the real object and the subjective
perception. Although so vital a distinction vanishes completely only in a practically psychotic
state, yet long before that point is reached subjective perception may influence thought, feeling,
and action to an extreme degree, in spite of the fact that the object is clearly seen in its fullest
reality. Whenever the objective influence does succeed in forcing its way into the subject -- as
the result of particular circumstances of special intensity, or because of a more perfect analogy
with the unconscious image -- even the normal example of this type is induced to act in
accordance with his unconscious model. Such action has an illusory quality in relation to
objective reality, and therefore has a very odd and strange character. It instantly reveals the anti-
real subjectivity of the type, But, where the influence of the object does not entirely succeed, it
encounters a benevolent neutrality, disclosing little sympathy, yet constantly striving to reassure
and adjust. The too-low is raised a little, the too-high is made a little lower; the enthusiastic is
damped, the [p. 503] extravagant restrained; and the unusual brought within the 'correct' formula:
all this in order to keep the influence of the object within the necessary bounds. Thus, this type
becomes an affliction to his circle, just in so far as his entire harmlessness is no longer above
suspicion. But, if the latter should be the case, the individual readily becomes a victim to the
aggressiveness and ambitions of others. Such men allow themselves to be abused, for which they
usually take vengeance at the most unsuitable occasions with redoubled stubbornness and
resistance. When there exists no capacity for artistic expression, all impressions sink into the
inner depths, whence they hold consciousness under a spell, removing any possibility it might
have had of mastering the fascinating impression by means of conscious expression. Relatively
speaking, this type has only archaic possibilities of expression for the disposal of his
impressions; thought and feeling are relatively unconscious, and, in so far as they have a certain
consciousness, they only serve in the necessary, banal, every-day expressions. Hence as
conscious functions, they are wholly unfitted to give any adequate rendering of the subjective
perceptions. This type, therefore, is uncommonly inaccessible to an objective understanding and
he fares no better in the understanding of himself.

Above all, his development estranges him from the reality of the object, handing him over to his
subjective perceptions, which orientate his consciousness in accordance with an archaic reality,
although his deficiency in comparative judgment keeps him wholly unaware of this fact.
Actually he moves in a mythological world, where men animals, railways, houses, rivers, and
mountains appear partly as benevolent deities and partly as malevolent demons. That thus they,

47

appear to him never enters his mind, although their effect upon his judgments and acts can bear
no other interpretation. He judges and acts as [p. 504] though he had such powers to deal with;
but this begins to strike him only when he discovers that his sensations are totally different from
reality. If his tendency is to reason objectively, he will sense this difference as morbid; but if, on
the other hand, he remains faithful to his irrationality, and is prepared to grant his sensation
reality value, the objective world will appear a mere make-belief and a comedy. Only in extreme
cases, however, is this dilemma reached. As a rule, the individual acquiesces in his isolation and
in the banality of the reality, which, however, he unconsciously treats archaically.

His unconscious is distinguished chiefly by the repression of intuition, which thereby acquires an
extraverted and archaic character. Whereas true extraverted intuition has a characteristic
resourcefulness, and a 'good nose' for every possibility in objective reality, this archaic,
extraverted intuition has an amazing flair for every ambiguous, gloomy, dirty, and dangerous
possibility in the background of reality. In the presence of this intuition the real and conscious
intention of the object has no significance; it will peer behind every possible archaic antecedent
of such an intention. It possesses, therefore, something dangerous, something actually
undermining, which often stands in most vivid contrast to the gentle benevolence of
consciousness. So long as the individual is not too aloof from the object, the unconscious
intuition effects a wholesome compensation to the rather fantastic and over credulous attitude of
consciousness. But as soon as the unconscious becomes antagonistic to consciousness, such
intuitions come to the surface and expand their nefarious influence: they force themselves
compellingly upon the individual, releasing compulsive ideas about objects of the most perverse
kind. The neurosis arising from this sequence of events is usually a compulsion neurosis, in
which the hysterical characters recede and are obscured by symptoms of exhaustion. [p. 505]

8. Intuition

Intuition, in the introverted attitude, is directed upon the inner object, a term we might justly
apply to the elements of the unconscious. For the relation of inner objects to consciousness is
entirely analogous to that of outer objects, although theirs is a psychological and not a physical
reality. Inner objects appear to the intuitive perception as subjective images of things, which,
though not met with in external experience, really determine the contents of the unconscious, i.e.
the collective unconscious, in the last resort. Naturally, in their per se character, these contents
are, not accessible to experience, a quality which they have in common with the outer object. For
just as outer objects correspond only relatively with our perceptions of them, so the phenomenal
forms of the inner object are also relative; products of their (to us) inaccessible essence and of
the peculiar nature of the intuitive function. Like sensation, intuition also has its subjective
factor, which is suppressed to the farthest limit in the extraverted intuition, but which becomes
the decisive factor in the intuition of the introvert. Although this intuition may receive its
impetus from outer objects, it is never arrested by the external possibilities, but stays with that
factor which the outer object releases within.

Whereas introverted sensation is mainly confined to the perception of particular innervation
phenomena by way of the unconscious, and does not go beyond them, intuition represses this
side of the subjective factor and perceives the image which has really occasioned the innervation.
Supposing, for instance, a man is overtaken by a psychogenic attack of giddiness. Sensation is

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

48

arrested by the peculiar character of this innervationdisturbance, perceiving all its qualities, its
intensity, its transient course, the nature of its origin and disappearance [p. 506] in their every
detail, without raising the smallest inquiry concerning the nature of the thing which produced the
disturbance, or advancing anything as to its content. Intuition, on the other hand, receives from
the sensation only the impetus to immediate activity; it peers behind the scenes, quickly
perceiving the inner image that gave rise to the specific phenomenon, i.e. the attack of vertigo, in
the present case. It sees the image of a tottering man pierced through the heart by an arrow. This
image fascinates the intuitive activity; it is arrested by it, and seeks to explore every detail of it. It
holds fast to the vision, observing with the liveliest interest how the picture changes, unfolds
further, and finally fades. In this way introverted intuition perceives all the background processes
of consciousness with almost the same distinctness as extraverted sensation senses outer objects.
For intuition, therefore, the unconscious images attain to the dignity of things or objects. But,
because intuition excludes the co-operation of sensation, it obtains either no knowledge at all or
at the best a very inadequate awareness of the innervation-disturbances or of the physical effects
produced by the unconscious images. Accordingly, the images appear as though detached from
the subject, as though existing in themselves without relation to the person.

Consequently, in the above-mentioned example, the introverted intuitive, when affected by the
giddiness, would not imagine that the perceived image might also in some way refer to himself.
Naturally, to one who is rationally orientated, such a thing seems almost unthinkable, but it is
none the less a fact, and I have often experienced it in my dealings with this type.

The remarkable indifference of the extraverted intuitive in respect to outer objects is shared by
the introverted intuitive in relation to the inner objects. Just as the extraverted intuitive is
continually scenting out new [p. 507] possibilities, which he pursues with an equal unconcern
both for his own welfare and for that of others, pressing on quite heedless of human
considerations, tearing down what has only just been established in his everlasting search for
change, so the introverted intuitive moves from image to image, chasing after every possibility in
the teeming womb of the unconscious, without establishing any connection between the
phenomenon and himself.  Just as the world can never become a moral problem for the man who
merely senses it, so the world of images is never a moral problem to the intuitive. To the one just
as much as to the other, it is an ae[]sthenic problem, a question of perception, a 'sensation'. In
this way, the consciousness of his own bodily existence fades from the introverted intuitive's
view, as does its effect upon others. The extraverted standpoint would say of him: 'Reality has no
existence for him; he gives himself up to fruitless phantasies'. A perception of the unconscious
images, produced in such inexhaustible abundance by the creative energy of life, is of course
fruitless from the standpoint of immediate utility. But, since these images represent possible
ways of viewing life, which in given circumstances have the power to provide a new energic
potential, this function, which to the outer world is the strangest of all, is as indispensable to the
total psychic economy as is the corresponding human type to the psychic life of a people. Had
this type not existed, there would have been no prophets in Israel.

Introverted intuition apprehends the images which arise from the a priori, i.e. the inherited
foundations of the unconscious mind. These archetypes, whose innermost nature is inaccessible
to experience, represent the precipitate of psychic functioning of the whole ancestral line, i.e. the
heaped-up, or pooled, experiences of organic existence in general, a million times repeated, and

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

49

condensed into types. Hence, in these archetypes all experiences are [p. 508] represented which
since primeval time have happened on this planet. Their archetypal distinctness is the more
marked, the more frequently and intensely they have been experienced. The archetype would be -
- to borrow from Kant -- the noumenon of the image which intuition perceives and, in
perceiving, creates.

Since the unconscious is not just something that lies there, like a psychic caput mortuum, but is
something that coexists and experiences inner transformations which are inherently related to
general events, introverted intuition, through its perception of inner processes, gives certain data
which may possess supreme importance for the comprehension of general occurrences: it can
even foresee new possibilities in more or less clear outline, as well as the event which later
actually transpires. Its prophetic prevision is to be explained from its relation to the archetypes
which represent the law-determined course of all experienceable things.

9. The Introverted Intuitive Type

The peculiar nature of introverted intuition, when given the priority, also produces a peculiar
type of man, viz. the mystical dreamer and seer on the one hand, or the fantastical crank and
artist on the other. The latter might be regarded as the normal case, since there is a general
tendency of this type to confine himself to the perceptive character of intuition. As a rule, the
intuitive stops at perception; perception is his principal problem, and -- in the case of a
productive artist-the shaping of perception. But the crank contents himself with the intuition by
which he himself is shaped and determined. Intensification of intuition naturally often results in
an extraordinary aloofness of the individual from tangible reality; he may even become a
complete enigma to his own immediate circle. [p. 509]

If an artist, he reveals extraordinary, remote things in his art, which in iridescent profusion
embrace both the significant and the banal, the lovely and the grotesque, the whimsical and the
sublime. If not an artist, he is frequently an unappreciated genius, a great man 'gone wrong', a
sort of wise simpleton, a figure for 'psychological' novels.

Although it is not altogether in the line of the introverted intuitive type to make of perception a
moral problem, since a certain reinforcement of the rational functions is required for this, yet
even a relatively slight differentiation of judgment would suffice to transfer intuitive perception
from the purely æsthetic into the moral sphere. A variety of this type is thus produced which
differs essentially from its æsthetic form, although none the less characteristic of the introverted
intuitive. The moral problem comes into being when the intuitive tries to relate himself to his
vision, when he is no longer satisfied with mere perception and its æsthetic shaping and
estimation, but confronts the question: What does this mean for me and for the world? What
emerges from this vision in the way of a duty or task, either for me or for the world? The pure
intuitive who represses judgment or possesses it only under the spell of perception never meets
this question fundamentally, since his only problem is the How of perception. He, therefore,
finds the moral problem unintelligible, even absurd, and as far as possible forbids his thoughts to
dwell upon the disconcerting vision. It is different with the morally orientated intuitive. He
concerns himself with the meaning of his vision; he troubles less about its further æsthetic
possibilities than about the possible moral effects which emerge from its intrinsic significance.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

50

His judgment allows him to discern, though often only darkly, that he, as a man and as a totality,
is in some way inter-related with his vision, that [p. 510] it is something which cannot just be
perceived but which also would fain become the life of the subject. Through this realization he
feels bound to transform his vision into his own life. But, since he tends to rely exclusively upon
his vision, his moral effort becomes one-sided; he makes himself and his life symbolic, adapted,
it is true, to the inner and eternal meaning of events, but unadapted to the actual present-day
reality. Therewith he also deprives himself of any influence upon it, because he remains
unintelligible. His language is not that which is commonly spoken -- it becomes too subjective.
His argument lacks convincing reason. He can only confess or pronounce. His is the 'voice of
one crying in the wilderness'.

The introverted intuitive's chief repression falls upon the sensation of the object. His unconscious
is characterized by this fact. For we find in his unconscious a compensatory extraverted
sensation function of an archaic character. The unconscious personality may, therefore, best be
described as an extraverted sensation-type of a rather low and primitive order. Impulsiveness and
unrestraint are the characters of this sensation, combined with an extraordinary dependence upon
the sense impression. This latter quality is a compensation to the thin upper air of the conscious
attitude, giving it a certain weight, so that complete 'sublimation' is prevented. But if, through a
forced exaggeration of the conscious attitude, a complete subordination to the inner perception
should develop, the unconscious becomes an opposition, giving rise to compulsive sensations
whose excessive dependence upon the object is in frank conflict with the conscious attitude. The
form of neurosis is a compulsion-neurosis, exhibiting symptoms that are partly hypochondriacal
manifestations, partly hypersensibility of the sense organs and partly compulsive ties to definite
persons or other objects. [p. 511]

10. Recapitulation of Introverted Irrational Types

The two types just depicted are almost inaccessible to external judgment. Because they are
introverted and have in consequence a somewhat meagre capacity or willingness for expression,
they offer but a frail handle for a telling criticism. Since their main activity is directed within,
nothing is outwardly visible but reserve, secretiveness, lack of sympathy, or uncertainty, and an
apparently groundless perplexity. When anything does come to the surface, it usually consists in
indirect manifestations of inferior and relatively unconscious functions. Manifestations of such a
nature naturally excite a certain environmental prejudice against these types. Accordingly they
are mostly underestimated, or at least misunderstood. To the same degree as they fail to
understand themselves -- because they very largely lack judgment -- they are also powerless to
understand why they are so constantly undervalued by public opinion. They cannot see that their
outward-going expression is, as a matter of fact, also of an inferior character. Their vision is
enchanted by the abundance of subjective events. What happens there is so captivating, and of
such inexhaustible attraction, that they do not appreciate the fact that their habitual
communications to their circle express very, little of that real experience in which they
themselves are, as it were, caught up. The fragmentary and, as a rule, quite episodic character of
their communications make too great a demand upon the understanding and good will of their
circle; furthermore, their mode of expression lacks that flowing warmth to the object which alone
can have convincing force. On the contrary, these types show very often a brusque, repelling
demeanour towards the outer world, although of this they are quite unaware, and have not the

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

51

least intention of showing it. We shall form a [p. 512] fairer judgment of such men and grant
them a greater indulgence, when we begin to realize how hard it is to translate into intelligible
language what is perceived within. Yet this indulgence must not be so liberal as to exempt them
altogether from the necessity of such expression. This could be only detrimental for such types.
Fate itself prepares for them, perhaps even more than for other men, overwhelming external
difficulties, which have a very sobering effect upon the intoxication of the inner vision. But
frequently only an intense personal need can wring from them a human expression.

From an extraverted and rationalistic standpoint, such types are indeed the most fruitless of men.
But, viewed from a higher standpoint, such men are living evidence of the fact that this rich and
varied world with its overflowing and intoxicating life is not purely external, but also exists
within. These types are admittedly one sided demonstrations of Nature, but they are an
educational experience for the man who refuses to be blinded by the intellectual mode of the day.
In their own way, men with such an attitude are educators and promoters of culture. Their life
teaches more than their words. From their lives, and not the least from what is just their greatest
fault, viz. their incommunicability, we may understand one of the greatest errors of our
civilization, that is, the superstitious belief in statement and presentation, the immoderate
overprizing of instruction by means of word and method. A child certainly allows himself to be
impressed by the grand talk of its parents. But is it really imagined that the child is thereby
educated? Actually it is the parents' lives that educate the child -- what they add thereto by word
and gesture at best serves only to confuse him. The same holds good for the teacher. But we have
such a belief in method that, if only the method be good, the practice of it seems to hallow the
teacher. An inferior [p. 513] man is never. a good teacher. But he can conceal his injurious
inferiority, which secretly poisons the pupil, behind an excellent method or, an equally brilliant
intellectual capacity. Naturally the pupil of riper years desires nothing better than the knowledge
of useful methods, because he is already defeated by the general attitude, which believes in the
victorious method. He has already learnt that the emptiest head, correctly echoing a method, is
the best pupil. His whole environment not only urges but exemplifies the doctrine that all success
and happiness are external, and that only the right method is needed to attain the haven of one's
desires. Or is the life of his religious instructor likely to demonstrate that happiness which
radiates from the treasure of the inner vision? The irrational introverted types are certainly no
instructors of a more complete humanity. They lack reason and the ethics of reason, but their
lives teach the other possibility, in which our civilization is so deplorably wanting.

11. The Principal and Auxiliary Functions

In the foregoing descriptions I have no desire to give my readers the impression that such pure
types occur at all frequently in actual practice. The are, as it were, only Galtonesque family-
portraits, which sum up in a cumulative image the common and therefore typical characters,
stressing these disproportionately, while the individual features are just as disproportionately
effaced. Accurate investigation of the individual case consistently reveals the fact that, in
conjunction with the most differentiated function, another function of secondary importance, and
therefore of inferior differentiation in consciousness, is constantly present, and is a -- relatively
determining factor. [p. 514]

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

For the sake of clarity let us again recapitulate: The products of all the functions can be
conscious, but we speak of the consciousness of a function only when not merely its application
is at the disposal of the will, but when at the same time its principle is decisive for the orientation
of consciousness. The latter event is true when, for instance, thinking is not a mere esprit de
l'escalier, or rumination, but when its decisions possess an absolute validity, so that the logical
conclusion in a given case holds good, whether as motive or as guarantee of practical action,
without the backing of any further evidence. This absolute sovereignty always belongs,
empirically, to one function alone, and can belong only to one function, since the equally
independent intervention of another function would necessarily yield a different orientation,
which would at least partially contradict the first. But, since it is a vital condition for the
conscious adaptation-process that constantly clear and unambiguous aims should be in evidence,
the presence of a second function of equivalent power is naturally forbidden' This other function,
therefore, can have only a secondary importance, a fact which is also established empirically. Its
secondary importance consists in the fact that, in a given case, it is not valid in its own right, as is
the primary function, as an absolutely reliable and decisive factor, but comes into play more as
an auxiliary or complementary function. Naturally only those functions can appear as auxiliary
whose nature is not opposed to the leading function. For instance, feeling can never act as the
second function by the side of thinking, because its nature stands in too strong a contrast to
thinking. Thinking, if it is to be real thinking and true to its own principle, must scrupulously
exclude feeling. This, of course, does not exclude the fact that individuals certainly exist in
whom thinking and feeling stand upon the same [p. 515] level, whereby both have equal motive
power in con~sdousness. But, in such a case, there is also no question of a differentiated type,
but merely of a relatively undeveloped thinking and feeling. Uniform consciousness and
unconsciousness of functions is, therefore, a distinguishing mark of a primitive mentality.

Experience shows that the secondary function is always one whose nature is different from,
though not antagonistic to, the leading function : thus, for example, thinking, as primary
function, can readily pair with intuition as auxiliary, or indeed equally well with sensation, but,
as already observed, never with feeling. Neither intuition nor sensation are antagonistic to
thinking, i.e. they have not to be unconditionally excluded, since they are not, like feeling, of
similar nature, though of opposite purpose, to thinking -- for as a judging function feeling
successfully competes with thinking -- but are functions of perception, affording welcome
assistance to thought. As soon as they reached the same level of differentiation as thinking, they
would cause a change of attitude, which would contradict the tendency of thinking. For they
would convert the judging attitude into a perceiving one; whereupon the principle of rationality
indispensable to thought would be suppressed in favour of the irrationality of mere perception.
Hence the auxiliary function is possible and useful only in so far as it serves the leading function,
without making any claim to the autonomy of its own principle.

For all the types appearing in practice, the principle holds good that besides the conscious main
function there is also a relatively unconscious, auxiliary function which is in every respect
different from the nature of the main function. From these combinations well-known pictures
arise, the practical intellect for instance paired with sensation, the speculative intellect breaking
through [p. 516] with intuition, the artistic intuition which selects. and presents its images by
means of feeling judgment, the philosophical intuition which, in league with a vigorous intellect,
translates its vision into the sphere of comprehensible thought, and so forth.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPES

A grouping of the unconscious functions also takes place in accordance with the relationship of
the conscious functions. Thus, for instance, an unconscious intuitive feeling attitude may
correspond with a conscious practical intellect, whereby the function of feeling suffers a
relatively stronger inhibition than intuition. This peculiarity, however, is of interest only for one
who is concerned with the practical psychological treatment of such cases. But for such a man it
is important to know about it. For I have frequently observed the way in which a physician, in
the case for instance of an exclusively intellectual subject, will do his utmost to develop the
feeling function directly out of the unconscious. This attempt must always come to grief, since it
involves too great a violation of the conscious standpoint. Should such a violation succeed, there
ensues a really compulsive dependence of the patient upon the physician, a 'transference' which
can be amputated only by brutality, because such a violation robs the patient of a standpoint --
his physician becomes his standpoint. But the approach to the unconscious and to the most
repressed function is disclosed, as it were, of itself, and with more adequate protection of the
conscious standpoint, when the way of development is via the secondary function-thus in the
case of a rational type by way of the irrational function. For this lends the conscious standpoint
such a range and prospect over what is possible and imminent that consciousness gains an
adequate protection against the destructive effect of the unconscious. Conversely, an irrational
type demands a stronger development of the rational auxiliary function [p. 517] represented in
consciousness, in order to be sufficiently prepared to receive the impact of the unconscious.

The unconscious functions are in an archaic, animal state. Their symbolical appearances in
dreams and phantasies usually represent the battle or coming encounter of two animals or
monsters.

WITH THE  uNDErPrIVILEGED

Abstract. The development of psychoanalytic technique can be traced in part to
the dialogues between Sigmund Freud and Sándor Ferenczi, dialogues that took
place in the context of psychoanalysis’s encounter with poverty and destitution
in the wake of World War I. These dialogues, which served as precursors to con-
temporary,  especially  Relational,  psychoanalysis,  also  inspired  Freud’s  call  for
greater psychoanalytic engagement with the poorest and most vulnerable. This
inspired the early psychoanalysts to “sharpen in all directions the sense of social
justice” by engaging in political activism, experimenting with clinical technique,
and by promoting short-term, more affordable treatments. The relevance of this
history for clinical work with diverse populations will be discussed, and aspects
of contemporary psychoanalysis (countertransference, enactment, new relational
experience) will be understood in light of Freud and Ferenczi’s responsiveness to
the underprivileged.

FREUD’S  (1918/ 1955a)  DISTINCTION   between  the  “pure  gold”  of

analysis  and  the  “copper”  of  direct  suggestion  is  often  invoked  to
mark the boundaries of orthodox psychoanalysis, and separate it from
the more “base” elements of supportive psychotherapy. The “pure gold”
of psychoanalysis refers to a long-term, interpretive approach in which
abstinent analyst and repressed analysand meet more than twice a week
in an open-ended therapy. The “copper” of direct suggestion traditionally
refers to any and all therapeutic methods that fall short of this “gold stan-
dard,” such as the supportive elements of the therapeutic relationship,
interventions spanning the gamut from Relational/ Interpersonal psycho-
analysis to cognitive-behavioral therapy and different varieties of short-

term  therapy.  These  alternative  therapies  are  defined  as  “other,”  deni-
grated  in  relation  to  the  idealized  method  of  cure.  This  application  of
Freud’s words, however, ignores the context in which he coined them,
and  the  two-sided  and  conflicted  purpose  for  which  they  were  devel-
oped.  The  context  of  these  terms  is  his  1918  keynote  at  the  Budapest
Congress,  “Lines  of  Advance  in  Psychoanalytic  Therapy,”  in  which  he
explored the modification and application of psychoanalysis to poor and
underprivileged persons who, until the 1920s, were generally marginal-
ized  from  psychoanalytic  treatment.  The  purpose of  distinguishing  be-
tween “pure gold” and “copper,” in turn, serves a double function of both
exclusion and inclusion, segregating psychoanalysis from the pragmatic
realities of psychotherapy, while calling for their integration in order to
forge what Freud referred to as a “psychotherapy for the people.”

The context of this article is the ever-changing face of psychoanalysis
in  the  United  States.  Recent  developments  in  psychoanalysis  in  the
United States have fostered the growth of Relational theory and practice,
which highlights the interpersonal context of the analytic relationship as
well as the role of the analyst’s subjectivity in the transference-counter-
transference  dance  (Greenberg  &  Mitchell,  1983;  Aron,  2001;  Wachtel,
2008). Increasing economic and political pressures (especially from man-
aged care companies) have led to the proliferation of short-term psycho-
dynamic therapies that take place once a week over the course of 12 to
40 sessions, and emphasize greater therapist activity and the formulation
of a focus to guide treatment (Crits-Christoph, Barber, & Kurcias, 1991;
Messer & Warren, 1995; Tosone, 1997). Finally, clinical work with diverse
populations has fostered an increasing awareness of race, class, culture,
and social justice in the analytic process (Perez-Foster, Moskowits, & Ja-
vier, 1996; Leary, 1997; Pogue-White, 2002; Altman, 2009). The purpose
of this article is to contextualize the historical origins of each of these
concerns—Relational  theory  and  practice,  short-term  psychodynamic
therapy, diversity and social justice—in the modification of psychoanaly-
sis in clinical work with the disenfranchised. Freud’s 1918 keynote speech
ignited the fires of social justice among the early analysts, and brought
him closer to one of his most esteemed, yet undervalued, colleagues—
Sándor Ferenczi.

Ferenczi  has  only  recently  been  recognized  for  his  contribution  to
psychoanalysis, today “created and found” as a forerunner of Relational
psychoanalysis  and  short-term  psychodynamic  therapy  (Neil  Altman,

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

personal communication). The reach of his influence, whether direct or
indirect, can be felt throughout the whole of psychotherapy; as Freud
recognized,  Ferenczi  “made  all  analysts  into  his  pupils”  (Freud,  1933/
1964). Echoes of Ferenczi’s ideas can be found in streams as diverse as
object  relations  theory,  self  psychology,  Interpersonal  and  Relational
psychoanalysis,  humanistic  psychotherapy,  and  short-term  psychody-
namic therapy (Marmor, 1980; Aron & Harris, 1993; Messer & Warren,
1995;  Rachman,  2007).1  Although  the  history  of  Freud  and  Ferenczi’s
relationship is tumultuous and tragic, their dialogues served as the anvil
on which a “psychotherapy for the people” was crafted. It is out of this
dialogue  that  I  hope  to  extract  some  possibilities  for  thinking  about
psychoanalytic  work  with  diverse,  and  all-to-often  underprivileged,
populations. I invite us to engage in what liberation psychology, a so-
cial  justice-oriented  movement  in  Latin  American  psychology,  calls  a
“recovery of historical memory” (Martin-Baro, 1994). This entails redis-
covering  those  elements  of  our  tradition  that  open  the  horizon  for  a
more dynamic and flexible psychoanalysis, a psychoanalysis that is re-
sponsive to the needs of the non-White, the poor, and the oppressed.

Tenacious  Healer,  relentless Advocate:  Ferenczi’s  Social  Passion

In Ferenczi’s writing, one finds ongoing self-scrutiny and reflection on
the challenges posed by the power difference between analyst and anal-
ysand,  and  how  this  inequality  must  be  negotiated  in  cases  of  severe
trauma. Arnold Rachman (2007), a psychoanalyst who pioneered the re-
surgence  of  interest  in  Ferenczi’s  life  and  work,  notes  that  Ferenczi’s
clinical experiments with empathy and mutuality were based on meticu-
lous observations of the therapeutic relationship, especially the patient’s
moment-to-moment reactions to the therapist. These experiments, rang-
ing  from  “active”  intervention  to  the  provision  of  reparative  emotional
experiences, pioneered the psychoanalytic treatment of complex trauma,
and “laid the foundation for a relational perspective in psychoanalysis”
(p. 76). It should come as no surprise, then, that before joining the psy-
choanalytic movement Ferenczi’s professional life involved clinical work

1  Although this is beyond the scope of this article, an argument can be made that Ferenczi’s
work foreshadowed some of the technical innovations of cognitive-behavioral therapy. See
below.

with  poor  and  oppressed  populations  who  were  victims  of  chronic
trauma  from  the  broader  society  (Rachman,  1993).  Although  Ferenczi,
like Freud, was embedded in cultural streams of patriarchy and misog-
yny,  and  no  less  likely  to  repeat  its  ideologies  wholesale  (Meszaros,
1993),  one  can  nevertheless  discern  that  he  struggled  with  these  dis-
courses. It is through this struggle that Ferenczi in turn challenged and
critiqued them.

Ferenczi,  who  was  Jewish  and  raised  in  a  household  of  progressive
values,  began  his  clinical  work  in  hospitals  devoted  to  work  with  the
poor and marginalized members of Hungarian society at the time. The
populations Ferenczi served often included men and women who were
persecuted  due  to  their  sexual  orientation,  or  were  pushed  into  such
destitution that prostitution became the only means for survival (Rach-
man, 1993). Perhaps the best known patient from Ferenczi’s preanalytic
days  is  “Rosa  K,”  a  lesbian  woman  who  was  condemned  as  a  “cross
dresser.” The publication of his therapeutic relationship with Rosa K was
the first article written in Hungarian calling on the medical community to
recognize the humanity of male and female homosexuals, and to reject
theories that pathologized and dehumanized them (Rachman, 1993).

Ferenczi saw Rosa K during his clinical tenure at St. Elizabeth’s Hospi-
tal for the poor in Budapest. Rachman’s (1993) moving depiction of their
encounter is suggestive of Ferenczi’s later clinical developments:

Ferenczi described the sad fate of Rosa K in an empathic way; it is clear
from his description of her that he was attempting to understand her, not
to judge, moralize about, or categorize her. Hunted, incarcerated, and op-
pressed  by  everyone,  Rosa  K,  like  most  homosexuals  at  the  turn  of  the
century, was socially isolated and emotionally unstable when she met the
young Ferenczi. The attitude of her family, the medical community, and
society at large toward Rosa K was universally negative, rejecting, and con-
demning. But Ferenczi viewed this “cursed” woman as a person. (p. 82)

In order to better understand her experience of interpersonal and sys-
temic trauma, Ferenczi encouraged her to write an autobiography, which
he used therapeutically. Ostracized by her parents, mocked by her peers,
unemployed and harassed by the police, forced into homelessness, pov-
erty, and discriminated against, her relationship with Ferenczi may have
been her first experience of recognition from an-other. Rachman (1993)
states that “[t]his early perspective of ‘the other in the treatment process’

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

145

was to become a significant theme in Ferenczi’s clinical work” (p. 84),
work that would redefine psychoanalysis into a transformative relational
encounter grounded in empathy.

Ferenczi’s clinical and social concerns for those who were oppressed
increased  after  he  joined  the  psychoanalytic  movement,  when  he  re-
flected on the sociopolitical implications of psychoanalysis soon after his
first meeting with Freud (Moreau-Ricaud, 1996). In 1908, Ferenczi openly
advocated for the rights of homosexuals, urging his analytic colleagues to
“take  sides  against  the  unfair  penal  sanctions  which  homosexuals  are
subjected to in many countries, especially in Germany, but also in our
country” (cited in Rachman, 1993, p. 84). Likewise, in a 1911 publication,
Ferenczi diagnosed alcoholism as a symptom of “social neurosis,” which
could be cured only by addressing its social etiology in psychoanalysis
and in society. Even earlier, in 1903, he presented a paper defending the
rights  of  exploited  medical  workers,  advocating  for  better  wages  and
improved working conditions (Sziklai, 2012).

Politics and society were also vibrant topics of conversation in Feren-
czi’s correspondence with Sigmund Freud. In a 1910 letter, Ferenczi at-
tempted to dissuade Freud from his belief in the inherent destructiveness
of human beings by arguing for the role of social factors in human suffer-
ing. Reflecting on a related insight by Carl Jung, Ferenczi drew attention
to  the  parallels  between  anti-Semitic  and  anti-Black  racism,  writing  to
Freud that “[t]he persecutions of [B]lacks in America [is because] [B]lacks
represent  the  unconscious  of  [White]  Americans.  Thus,  the  hate  . . .
against one’s own vices . . . could also be the basis for anti-Semitism. It is
only since my analysis that I have understood the widespread Hungarian
saying: ‘I hate him like my sins’” (cited in Meyer, 2005, p.19). These social
reflections were, in turn, tied to clinical observations, as Ferenczi intuited
that in psychoanalysis “we investigate the real conditions in the various
levels of society, cleansed of all hypocrisy and conventionalism, just as
they are mirrored in the individual” (Ferenczi, 1993).

The challenge of the here-and-now relationship between therapist and
patient, and the role of empathy, were clinical questions that took their
earliest form in Ferenczi’s experiences with oppressed individuals. The
“ethics of truth and justice” (Borossa, 2007) present in Ferenczi’s clinical
and social thought were further nurtured by Freud’s own social awaken-
ing, and the direction in which he would take psychoanalysis at the 1918
Budapest Congress.

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

The  Origin,  Meaning,  and  Effect  of  the  1918  Budapest  Speech

Freud and Ferenczi’s dialogues from 1910 through 1918 led to a deeper
commitment on Freud’s part to expand the scope of psychoanalysis to
consider the plight of the masses rendered destitute in the wake of World
War I. The ideas that would later become part of his 1918 keynote speech
were first put to paper in the summer prior to the Budapest Congress,
during  Freud’s  stay  in  the  home  of  Anton  von  Freund.  Von  Freund,  a
friend and training analysand of both Freud and Ferenczi (Danto, 2005),
spoke with Freud about donating part of his fortune to help create a psy-
choanalytic clinic for the poor in Budapest. Although the first psychoana-
lytic free clinic would actually be built in Berlin, Freud would later write
that  von  Freund’s  vision  would  “sharpen  in  all  directions  the  sense  of
social justice” within psychoanalysis (Freud, 1920/1955b, p. 267). Freud’s
Budapest speech was influenced not only by von Freund’s plans for a
community-based clinic, but also by Ferenczi’s experiments with time-
limited therapy and “active” intervention during World War I. Based on
these experiments with “active treatment,” Freud envisioned new direc-
tions and challenges in psychoanalysis, and reflected on their implica-
tions for work with the underprivileged.

In “Lines of Advance in Psychoanalytic Therapy,” Freud (1918/ 1955a)
referred  to  Ferenczi’s  “active  technique”  as  a  step  forward  in  psycho-
analysis’s  evolution  as  a  treatment.  “Active  technique”  involved  two
types  of  interventions.  The  first  was  what  Ferenczi  termed  “admoni-
tions,”  in  which  patients  were  encouraged  to  gradually  expose  them-
selves to their phobia-inducing or anxiety-provoking objects within and
outside the session, thus exposing them to the avoided affect associated
with  those  objects.  The  second  set  of  interventions  involved  “prohibi-
tions,” in which patients were instructed to cease self-soothing or com-
pulsive  behaviors  in  order  to  experience  the  defended-against  anxiety
without incurring the feared catastrophe. These techniques—presaging
exposure, response prevention, and desensitization-based behavior ther-
apies by almost a century—were to serve as supplements to an interpre-
tive  method,  as  they  allowed  repressed  thoughts,  affects,  wishes,  and
memories to emerge into consciousness in order to be worked through
psychoanalytically. Their application was highly dependent on the pa-
tient-therapist bond, which created a safe space within which the feared
situation  could  be  enacted,  without  the  expected  traumatic  result  (see
also  Ferenczi,  1926/ 1980).  Although  cautious  about  the  analyst’s  in-

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

147

creased role in “active therapy,” Freud welcomed the application of these
interventions as outlined by Ferenczi (1918, p. 165).

Turning from the clinical to the social, Freud (1918/ 1955a) addressed
“the vast amount of neurotic misery which there is in the world, and per-
haps need not be” (p. 165). Lamenting psychoanalysis’s inability to serve
the majority of displaced and poor people after World War I, he foresaw
a future in which “the conscience of society will awake,” and compel it to
take responsibility for their psychological as well as material well-being.
Probably as a result of Ferenczi and von Freund’s influence, Freud pro-
posed the creation of outpatient clinics staffed by psychoanalytic clini-
cians, where “treatments will be free” (p. 165). At such clinics, analysts
would “be faced by the task of adapting [psychoanalytic] technique to the
new conditions” (p. 167). Freud suggested that clients who lacked formal
education should be provided appropriate psychoeducation, demystify-
ing psychoanalysis and making them active participants in treatment. He
further  intuited  that  for  such  treatments  to  be  successful,  it  would  be
necessary  to  address  the  client’s  economic  as  well  as  psychological
needs, “[combining] mental assistance with some material support, in the
manner of the Emperor Joseph” (p. 167), a revered advocate of Jewish
minorities and the poor.

Concluding his speech, Freud (1918/ 1955a) made a critical prediction
about  the  future  of  psychoanalytic  treatment  with  the  many  impover-
ished people of the postwar world, one that was to cast its shadow over
the whole of psychoanalytic discourse on relationship and technique:

It is very probable, too, that the large-scale application of our therapy will
compel us to alloy the pure gold of analysis freely with the copper of direct
suggestion; and hypnotic influence, too, might find a place in it again, as it
has in the treatment of war neurosis. But, whatever form this psychother-
apy for the people may take, whatever the elements out of which it is com-
pounded, its most effective and most important ingredients will assuredly
remain  those  borrowed  from  strict  and  untendentious  psycho-analysis.
(pp. 167–168; emphases added)

Sociologist and historian Elizabeth Danto (2005), to whom we are in-
debted for bringing the history of social justice in psychoanalysis to light,
has chronicled the remarkable effect of Freud’s speech on the psycho-
analytic  movement.  In  the  vibrant  period  between  1918  and  1938,  the
first generation of analysts responded to Freud’s words “half as prophecy
and  half  as  challenge”  (Eitington,  1923),  opening  clinics  in  Berlin,  Vi-

148

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

enna,  London,  Paris,  and  elsewhere,  offering  pro bono  or  sliding-scale
psychosocial relief for the poor, developing new treatment methods, and
participating in various feminist, gay rights, and socialist-Marxist move-
ments seeking social change in post-World War I Europe (Danto, 2005).
In order to meet the needs of a broader range of people, psychoanalytic
practitioners such as Franz Alexander, Max Eitington, Ernst Simmel, and
Sándor Ferenczi experimented with time-limited treatment and “active”
interventions that increased the use of overt behavioral change strategies
and  the  role  of  the  therapeutic  relationship  (Danto,  2005).  Freud  ap-
peared  to  encourage  such  explorations,  although  his  ambivalence  to-
ward findings discrepant from his own was nevertheless notable (Haynal,
1993, p. 60; cf. Giampieri-Deutsch, 1996).

Freud’s keynote is striking both for its progressive energies and its con-
servative pull. Freud welcomed the therapeutic interventions developed
by Ferenczi, even to the point of seeing in them the future of psychoana-
lytic technique, yet rendered them subservient to his “classical” approach.
Hence, Freud simultaneously called for the integration of his “analysis”
and Ferenczi’s “direct suggestion,” while delegitimizing, denigrating, and
devaluing the latter as “copper” and defining the former as “pure gold.”
Going a step further, Freud remarked that although these “copper” inno-
vations may be welcome, perhaps even necessary, in providing services
to impoverished populations traumatized by the ravages of war, the real
ingredients of change would be analytic interpretations (i.e., “pure gold”).
Reflecting Freud’s hesitant downgrading of the intrapsychic (i.e., transfer-
ential and interpretive) type of psychoanalysis to the advice-giving and
even directive kinds of psychotherapy, this passage has been criticized—
not unjustly—as laying the groundwork for later stereotypic statements
about the poor not being “analyzable” or capable of real psychoanalytic
work  due  to  lack  of  ego-strength  and  psychological  mindedness,  and,
therefore,  in  need  of  a  baser,  more  “supportive”  and  directive  therapy
(Altman, 1995/ 2009; Wachtel, 2002). I will return to this problem of “ana-
lyzability” when I examine the implications of this controversy for con-
temporary work with underprivileged populations.

In coining the terms “pure gold” and “copper,” Freud set the “terms of
engagement”  (Paul  Wachtel,  personal  communication)  between  what
would be seen as “strict and untendentious” psychoanalysis and those
degradations that would become its various “others,” such as “psychody-
namic” and short-term therapy, “supportive” therapy, and emerging rela-
tional  trends  in  analytic  theory.  On  the  other  hand,  these  terms  also

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

149

functioned inclusively, and they allowed Ferenczi and other first-genera-
tion analysts to play with the boundaries of technique and create some-
thing new. As long as analysts understood these terms, did not stray too
far from Freud’s position, or argue that these new approaches were of
equal value to analytic interpretation, they could experiment freely with
technique. This back and forth between either/ or and both/ and betrays a
deep ambivalence we have inherited from Freud. A no less ambivalent
example of Freud’s enthusiasm and reserve for the development of tech-
nique,  followed  by  eventual  excommunication,  is  Ferenczi  and  Rank’s
monograph, The Development of Psychoanalysis (1925).

The  Development  of  a “Psychotherapy  for  the  People”

Aided by Freud’s encouragement, Ferenczi and Otto Rank initiated fur-
ther clinical experiments on therapeutic activity and the role of the ana-
lyst in the healing process (Haynal, 1993; Rachman, 2007). In The Devel-
opment  of  Psychoanalysis  (1925),  Rank  and  Ferenczi  expressed  their
concern that clinical technique remained frozen in time while psycho-
analytic theory soared to new insights (p. 2). Seeking to correct the atro-
phy of technique, they revisited Freud’s earlier technical paper, “Remem-
bering, Repeating, and Working Through” (1914), and created a series of
reversals in their understanding of analysis. Although Freud emphasized
the role of cognitive remembering, Ferenczi and Rank (1925) attributed
the primary mechanism of change to “repetition” (p. 4), the enactment of
the patient’s core conflicts within the analytic session.

“The creation of the analytic situation,” Ferenczi and Rank write, “re-
ally exposes the patient a second time to his infantile trauma . . . [reliving]
the Oedipus situation in the relation of the patient to the analyst, in order
to bring it, with the help of the patient’s insight, to a new and more for-
tunate conclusion” (pp. 20, 54; emphasis added). The patient’s forbidden
wishes, feelings, and thoughts were to be enacted in relation to the ana-
lyst, consciously reexperienced, and allowed a “partial gratification” (p.
19)  through  the  analyst’s  empathic  responsiveness.  Bringing  the  core
conflict  to  a  “new  and  more  fortunate  conclusion”  (p.  54)  makes  new
emotional and historical material available to consciousness, allowing the
transition from repetition to remembering. Prioritizing repetition in rela-
tion to the therapist also placed “affective factors of experience” (p. 62)
at the center of the change process, effectively reversing the relationship
between pure gold and copper, as insight is framed as an important re-

150

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

sult of new emotional experiences, and intellectualization as a resistance
that must be overcome by experiencing avoided affect within a respon-
sive relationship.

Ferenczi and Rank (1925) conclude their text by anchoring their tech-
nical recommendations  in  Freud’s Budapest speech  (p. 58). Revisiting
Freud’s suggestion that psychoanalytic knowledge be conveyed to im-
poverished patients in simple and straightforward terms, Ferenczi and
Rank likewise suggest that “[t]he reduction of the method to more sim-
ple actual facts . . . would [make it] much easier for doctors . . . to ac-
quire psycho-analytic knowledge” (p. 63). It is not only the uneducated
poor who would need the intricate nature of psychoanalytic theory to
be “boiled down” to the pragmatic terms of the therapeutic process, but
educated doctors  and  physicians  as well! But, simplifying the esoteric
nature of psychoanalytic theory and concretizing its precepts into prag-
matic interventions would have another purpose for Ferenczi and Rank:
it would “shorten and simplify the treatment” (p. 63). With the repeti-
tion of the core trauma in the transference, its subsequent transforma-
tion into remembrance through relational-affective reexperiencing, and
provision of a corrective experience to the patient’s catastrophic expec-
tations, a path is carved for the setting of treatment goals and a focus
on those particular areas in a person’s psychic life in which they experi-
ence difficulty.

Finally, citing Freud’s opinion that the “the pure gold of analysis might
be freely alloyed with the copper of direct suggestion” in the modifica-
tion  of  psychoanalysis  with  the  poor,  Ferenczi  and  Rank  (1925)  argue
that psychoanalysis no longer needs to exist in “splendid isolation” from
other  therapeutic  methods.  They  wonder  “if  the  point  were  finally
reached  when  other  psycho-therapeutic  methods  which  had  proven
themselves  useful  according  to  analytic  understanding  . . .  were  legiti-
mately combined with psycho-analysis” (p. 64). In this regard, Ferenczi
and  Rank  may  qualify  as  the  first  assimilative  integrationists  (Messer,
1992), as they consider employing nonanalytic methods by “assimilating”
them  within  a  broader  psychoanalytic  perspective.2  Rather  than  being
subservient adjuncts to psychoanalysis, as it was understood at that time,
“other psycho-therapeutic methods” were to be integrated on an equal
level.

2  Paul Wachtel’s (1997) work is a contemporary example of psychotherapy integration, as
he assimilates cognitive-behavioral interventions within psychoanalytic therapy.

151

Ferenczi and Rank’s The Development of Psychoanalysis (1925) could
in many ways be read as “The Development of a Psychotherapy for the
People.” It is a direct descendant of Freud’s “Lines of Advance in Psycho-
analytic  Therapy”  (1918/ 1955a),  in  which  he  highlights  the  increasing
importance of the analyst’s activity in treatment. This acknowledgment of
the  analyst’s  role  is  the  result  of  applying  the  underlying  principles  of
“active” intervention to the therapeutic relationship itself. What began as
a series of techniques employed to expose patients to the avoided affect,
anxiety, and pain elicited by objects in the world (a technique we associ-
ate today with behavioral exposure therapy), was now influencing the
way Ferenczi and Rank thought about the patient-therapist relationship.
The therapeutic relationship itself would be the context in which patients
are  exposed  to  disowned  affect  and  desire  through  the  person  of  the
analyst,  who  provides  a  corrective  experience  through  their  empathic,
nonretaliatory responsiveness. Ferenczi and Rank here cite the applica-
tion of psychoanalysis to the poor as a source of their technical recom-
mendations, applying those insights in a way that affectively deepened
the  transference  relation.  Hence,  their  monograph  is  a  product  of  the
progressive energies unleashed by Freud’s own reflections on the future
of analytic technique, and their application to the vast numbers of im-
poverished people in post-World War I Europe.

Ferenczi  and  Rank’s  (1925)  monograph  destabilized  the  relationship
between classical psychoanalysis and other treatment modalities by con-
textualizing insight in affect, memory in enactment, and repetition in re-
lationship, thus, redefining and “refin[ing] the gold of psychoanalysis it-
self” (Szecsody, 2007). Their work proved to be an important precursor
to the development of Relational psychoanalysis and short-term dynamic
therapy. Both traditions  trace their lineage  to Ferenczi  and  Rank’s  text
and, although they might disagree on the place of short-term therapy in
psychoanalysis, they would both agree on the crucial role of the here-
and-now  relationship,  and  the  mutative  power  of  the  analyst’s  attun-
ement to the patient’s affective experience (Tosone, 1997; cf. Aron, 1993;
2001). It is a key element of these two traditions, an element that can be
traced back to the disjunctions and conjunctions of Freud and Ferenczi’s
dialogues  on  psychoanalytic  technique  and  their  application  to  under-
served populations. Ferenczi’s contributions, based in part on these dia-
logues,  emerged  from  a  process  of  clinical  experimentation  that  at-
tempted to meet the needs of a variety of traumatized, oppressed, and
socially marginalized populations (Rachman, 1993).

Gold,  copper,  and  the “Other”: A  Ferenczian Take  on Analyzability

Ferenczi’s  continued  elucidation  of  a  relational  perspective  after  1925
echoed an “ethics of truth and justice” (Borossa, 2007), demonstrating his
ongoing focus on the power difference between the therapist (who rep-
resents the social order) and the patient (whose symptomotology is the
result of flawed relationships with that social order). In his seminal arti-
cle,  “Confusion  of  Tongues”  (1949/ 1988),  Ferenczi  took  a  radical  step
forward in theory and practice:

Gradually, then, I came to the conclusion that the patients have an exceed-
ingly refined sensitivity for the wishes, tendencies, whims, sympathies and
antipathies of their analyst, even if the analyst is completely unaware of
this  sensitivity. . . .  The  analytical  situation—i.e.  the  restrained  coolness,
the professional hypocrisy and—hidden behind it but never revealed—a
dislike of the patient which, nevertheless, he felt in all his being—such a
situation was not essentially different from that which in his childhood had
led to the illness. . . . The setting free of [the patient’s] critical feelings, the
willingness on our part to admit our mistakes and the honest endeavor to
avoid them in [the] future, all these go to create in the patient a confidence
in the analyst. (pp. 198–200)

Ferenczi noted that patients who were repeatedly abused and invali-
dated often develop an exquisite perceptiveness of others’ internal states.
If the analyst experiences and then disowns his or her negative counter-
transference to such patients, there is a risk of communicating these reac-
tions unconsciously through one’s behavior. Denying these reactions in
turn invalidates the patient’s reality and ruptures trust in the analyst, re-
peating the original traumatic event with significant caretakers. But, by
owning  their  countertransference  reactions,  disclosing  them  to  the  pa-
tient, and validating their reality, the analyst provides a corrective experi-
ence that increases the patient’s trust in this relationship. It is precisely
this process of rupture, reconnection, and repair that, Ferenczi argued,
leads to the curative power of the therapeutic relationship, influencing
much  relational  thinking  on  enactments  (Aron,  2001;  Benjamin,  2004).
This  relational,  two-person  perspective  has  powerful  implications  for
work with the underprivileged or culturally different, especially with re-
gard to the criteria of analyzability (Altman, 1995/ 2009; Wachtel, 2002).

The criterion of analyzability refers to a cluster of attributes that define
the  “kind”  of  people  that  can  be  effectively  treated  in  psychoanalysis.

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

These  include  psychological  mindedness,  ego-strength,  verbal  intelli-
gence, frustration tolerance, and impulse control. Those who have these
traits  are  considered  treatable  by  the  “pure  gold”  of  psychoanalysis,
whereas those who do not are referred to the “copper” of supportive or
less  intensive  psychotherapy.  Altman  (1995/ 2009)  and  Wachtel  (2002)
argue that such criteria have been used to exclude ethnic minorities and
the poor from psychoanalytic treatment, leading to sociocultural enact-
ments in which practitioners decree that non-White, lower income popu-
lations are less amenable to analytic treatment and more responsive to,
for example, more “directive” cognitive-behavioral approaches.3 What is
interesting about the so-called analyzability criteria is that it places the
onus of engaging in the psychoanalytic process squarely on the patient,
especially if the patient is a racial or socioeconomically different “other.”
The analyst’s role in defining analyzability is entirely obscured.

Speaking from a relational perspective, Altman (1997/ 2009) argues that
“[d]iscussions of analyzability, in which lower-class patients often end up
on the unanalyzable side, may reflect the analyst’s psychic defensive op-
erations” (p. 92). What might be framed as the patient’s inability to en-
gage in the analytic process may, in fact, reflect the analyst’s inability to
engage the patient. The analyst’s wish to be a competent, empathically
attuned listener may be frustrated by biases and reactions operating out-
side of his or her awareness. In turn, the analyst’s difficulties and insecu-
rities in making empathic contact are projected upon the patient, who is
then  deemed  unanalyzable  (Frosch,  2006).  In  a  parallel  spirit,  Frosch
(2006) writes that “the analyst’s idea about psychoanalysis is an essential
variable that contributes to our concept of analyzability. And the analyst’s
ideas  are  always  shaped  by  desire.  Wishes  and  defenses  organize  our
perception of the world, including the world of who is or is not analyz-
able” (p. 51; emphasis added). How we think about what psychoanalysis
is, or is not, defines who we will and will not treat, because those we can
treat are more likely to be “like us,” making us feel safe and competent,
whereas those we cannot treat, the “not-me,” make us feel unsafe, in-
competent, and uncomfortable. “Analyzable” and “unanalyzable” inevita-
bly become shorthand terms for who gets the pure gold or the copper,
distinguishing  the  “me”  from  the  “not-me.”  To  take  this  intersubjective
reality  into  account  would  mean  redefining  analyzability  as  something
that  “is  dependent  on  . . .  a  reciprocal  relationship  that  allows  for  the

3  See Brown’s (2009) insightful commentary on this dynamic.

154

development of mutual trust” (Frosch, 2006, p. 52). Thus, analyzability is
not determined by the supposed ego-strengths or deficits inherent in the
patient, but is a function of each therapist-patient dyad’s capacity to es-
tablish a trusting relationship. Given the asymmetrical nature of this re-
lationship  (Orange,  2010),  it  becomes  imperative  that  we  examine  the
unconscious assumptions that may impede the analyst’s empathy, attun-
ement, and understanding of the culturally different patient. In keeping
with  Ferenczi’s  thinking,  the  onus  of  analyzability—or  at  least  a  great
deal of the responsibility for setting the conditions for psychoanalysis—
falls on the subjectivity of the therapist.

A useful framework for thinking about this topic is Derald Wing Sue’s
(2010) work on “microaggressions.” Microaggressions are often uncon-
scious,  “brief  and  commonplace  daily  verbal,  behavioral,  and  environ-
mental indignities . . . that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative
racial, gender, sexual-orientation, and religious slights and insults to the
target person or group” (p. 5). Whereas members of privileged groups
(e.g.,  White,  male,  heterosexual,  middle-upper  class,  able)  are  usually
unaware of these implicit transactions, members of nondominant groups
over time develop a finely tuned hypervigilance of such exchanges. All
too often, people of minority backgrounds may detect that a microag-
gression  has  taken  place,  whereas  the  more  dominant  person—in  our
case,  the  psychotherapist—invalidates  the  minority’s  experience  either
by being unaware of a misstep, ignoring its impact on the other, or ex-
plicitly denying that anything problematic has transpired. The ethnic mi-
nority,  the  poor  person,  the  female,  or  the  nonheterosexual  suddenly
finds his or her internal reality usurped by an “other,” leading to “a great
deal of self-confusion and pain,” as described by Kathleen Pogue-White
(2002, p. 405). Reflecting on her experience as a woman of color, Pogue-
White writes that “[e]rring on the side of wariness and vigilance” (p. 405)
is an adaptive defense utilized by people who have been victims of prej-
udice and injustice, a sentiment that runs parallel to the experiences of
chronically traumatized people.

Having reviewed the empirical literature available in the 1970s, Siassi
and Messer (1976) concluded that White, middle- and upper-class thera-
pists often hold negative stereotypes of the poor, unconscious attitudes
that affect the interpersonal interaction and impair therapeutic empathy.
These stereotypes can lead impoverished patients to experience rejection
and drop out of treatment. Contemporary research has shown that this
tragic reality still exists, showing that therapists who act out their preju-

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

155

dices corrode the therapeutic relationship. If this is not addressed, the
chances that a minority patient will leave treatment are greater, further
adding to the dropout rate for ethnic minorities in general (Gaztambide,
in press). Although the issue of therapist responsiveness and attunement
is not limited to work with underprivileged populations, it is especially
relevant to them. Questions of power, rupture, attunement, and trust are
central to cultural competence (Gaztambide, in press), and one can find
each of these topics reflected in Ferenczi’s (1949/ 1988) later thinking. His
awareness of the patient’s sensitivity to the therapist’s often subtle nega-
tive reactions provides a clinically useful way of addressing microaggres-
sions and cultural enactments in the here-and-now (Altman, 1995/ 2009;
cf. Sue, 2010). Ferenczi calls attention to the inevitability of the therapist
taking on the role of perpetrator vis-à-vis the patient, and reminds us of
the need for critical self-reflection and honest self-disclosure in order to
reconnect with the patient, repairing the injury provoked by therapeutic
missteps. His later development of the concept of mutuality suggests that
paying attention to cultural prejudices, accepting them when they arise,
and owning them with our patients will help restore trust in the thera-
peutic relationship and make the work of analysis possible. Attention to
cultural misattunements may reveal that the “unanalyzable patient” is a
product  of  the  therapist’s  unconscious  assumptions  about  the  patient
based on cultural or socioeconomic biases that derail the work of analy-
sis. And, if the work of psychoanalysis is to make the “unconscious, con-
scious,” then the task of a “psychotherapy for the people” is to make the
unanalyzable, analyzable.

Elements  and Alloys: An  Outline  and  case  Illustration

Another set of insights to be drawn from the efforts of the early analysts
lead us to a critique of Relational theory itself, specifically its dyad-cen-
tricity. An implicit belief in Relational theory, and psychoanalysis more
broadly,  is  that  the  analysand’s  difficulties  can  be  resolved  within  the
boundaries of the treatment dyad without addressing their ecological sur-
round,  including  not  only  their  relationships  with  “real  others”  in  the
world but also the broader systems in which the dyad is embedded (Paul
Wachtel,  personal  communication;  cf.  Cushman,  1994;  Altman,  1995/
2009). Many early analysts recognized the need to “combine mental as-
sistance with some material support,” thus reducing their fees for poor
clients  and  engaging  systemic  issues  socially,  politically,  and  academi-

156

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

cally (Danto, 2005). This suggests a perspective that grounds the thera-
peutic relationship within a broader sociocultural context, as seen in con-
temporary  reflections  on  the  social  “third”  (Cushman,  1994;  Altman,
1995/ / 2009). Such a perspective would not only invite dialogue on social
dynamics as they are reflected in transference-countertransference enact-
ments,  but  would  also  suggest  that—under  certain  circumstances—the
analyst may need to engage the broader social matrix directly, through
systemic  intervention,  advocacy,  and  client  empowerment,  as  seen  in
many family therapy approaches (e.g. Boyd-Franklin, 2003).

As noted above, several-times-a-week, long-term psychoanalysis may
not be a treatment option for many underprivileged people. This is due
to economic and logistical reasons rather than psychological ones. Many
lower-income populations cannot afford therapy multiple times a week
over an extended period of time. Aside from more immediate financial
restraints, many individuals and families do not have the time to engage
in this kind of therapy. In spite of what some stereotypes of the poor
(e.g.,  “lazy”  or  “undeserving”)  lead  us  to  believe,  many  impoverished
people may be working hard to maintain a 40-hour a week job, or work
several part-time jobs in order to make ends meet or, if unemployed, are
working diligently to secure a new job. In addition, other issues—e.g.,
access to adequate transportation to and from therapy—may complicate
the use of frequent sessions. Therapy in such circumstances becomes a
luxury, one that demands time, money, and other  resources. Once  (at
most twice) a week treatment on a short-term basis (e.g., 12–40 sessions)
may be a more feasible alternative, financially and logistically.

As suggested by Freud (1918/  1955a), psychoeducation may prove to
be a useful tool for engaging clients from diverse backgrounds in treat-
ment. Nancy McWilliams (2004) notes that psychoeducation has not re-
ceived sufficient attention in the psychoanalytic literature, although most
patients would benefit from preparation for the therapy process (p. 86).
This might be even more important for patients from cultures that do not
regularly engage in psychotherapy, or for whom therapy is stigmatized.
A  useful  distinction  might  be  drawn  between  the  traditionally  didactic
kind of psychoeducation found in some treatment modalities, and a more
process-oriented  psychoeducation  that  draws  on  myth  and  metaphor.
Didactic psychoeducation involves the therapist speaking as an authority
and  conveying  direct  information  to  the  patient.  Process-oriented  psy-
choeducation makes psychoanalytic ideas, such as affect regulation, de-
fenses,  and  transference-countertransference  enactments,  understand-

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

157

able to patients as they arise and are addressed in the moment. McWilliams
sees metaphor as a rich medium through which to educate the patient in
these moments, especially when metaphors are employed in a manner
that is experience-near and culturally congruent (pp. 86–87). Exploration
of the patient’s cultural world may reveal a complex set of symbols that
can be drawn upon in orienting them to psychoanalytic therapy.

By placing the relationship at the core of the analytic endeavor and
inviting the integration of techniques seen as “non-psychoanalytic,” Fe-
renczi  refined  the  gold  of  psychoanalysis  itself  (Szecsody,  2007).  This
leads to an interesting question for analysis today. If Relational psycho-
analysis and short-term psychodynamic therapy are the products of this
refined gold, is there not the risk of creating a new “copper” to serve as
“other” and foil to this “gold” (cf. Curtis, 1996)? Are cognitive-behavioral,
family systems, and even experiential/ humanistic therapies not rendered
the contemporary “copper” of psychoanalysis? If so, are we to invoke the
language of pure gold and copper anew to keep these different systems
apart (and only tentatively related, if at all)? Or, are we to create new al-
loys, further refining psychoanalysis instead?

I will now present a case that illustrates some of the elements of a
“psychotherapy  for  the  people”  as  discussed  in  this  article.  The  case
itself is a pastiche of my pregraduate and graduate school clinical ex-
periences providing mental health services in a variety of underserved
settings (e.g., inner city outpatient clinics, in-home therapy, community
externship  placements).  I  have  chosen  to  create  a  pastiche  instead  of
drawing  on  a  specific  case  in  order  to  preserve  anonymity  and  draw
greater attention to the clinical process. To be clear, this is but one ex-
ample of the possible alloys crafted from the elements of contemporary
psychoanalysis.

Pablo  (pseudonym)  was  a  28-year-old,  male,  low-income,  bilingual,
Latin American undocumented immigrant who sought psychotherapy at
our clinic due to anxiety symptoms that affected his day-to-day life. At
intake,  he  stated  he  was  a  Spanish-dominant  speaker,  and  would  feel
more comfortable working with someone who was bilingual. Because I
am an island-born Puerto Rican who is bilingual, I offered to pick up the
case. After an initial assessment, it became clear that Pablo suffered from
post-traumatic stress disorder related to his immigration experience. Al-
though Pablo wanted psychological help, he confessed that he did not
have a lot of money. As the clinic charged for services on a sliding scale,
we were able to negotiate an affordable fee. Given Pablo’s hectic work

158

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

schedule, arrangements were made for once a week treatment. Also, be-
cause I am a graduate student who takes vacation time at the end of each
semester, we agreed to review progress and the need for further treat-
ment at the end of the current semester.

During the first couple of sessions, I asked Pablo how he felt talking to
me about his problems. Pablo disclosed that he felt comfortable with me,
which was a relief to him because he worried we would not have “una
buena onda” (a good vibe). Considering the importance of interpersonal
warmth  (personalismo)  and  trust  (confianza)  for  many  Latinos,  I  used
this  moment  as  an  opportunity  for  psychoeducation.  I  told  him  that  it
was good for us to have a “good vibe,” because we could use the chem-
istry between us as a way of exploring his needs and concerns. This be-
came  Pablo’s  introduction  to  transference  and  the  relational  nature  of
psychotherapy. Throughout our work together, I used similar moments
and metaphors to explain the analytic process, and make psychotherapy
a less alien and stigmatizing experience.

Given Pablo’s post-traumatic stress symptoms, I employed relaxation
and distress reduction skills training from cognitive-behavioral therapy,
with the understanding that improving emotional regulation would fa-
cilitate the exploration and expression of the underlying emotions as-
sociated with his traumatic experience. By increasing Pablo’s repertoire
of  coping  skills  and  gradually  beginning  to  discuss  his  immigration
experience, he became more tolerant of previously unbearable anxiety,
giving him the emotional freedom to disclose more details of his trauma.
After  some  sessions  of  this  kind  of  work,  we  agreed  we  could  begin
exploring  Pablo’s  trauma  in  full.  As  I  listened  to  Pablo’s  story,  there
were moments in which his range of affect suddenly narrowed, and his
narrative  became  more  constrained  and  less  detailed.  He  would  then
cease  talking  about  his  narrative  altogether  and  demand  to  know  if  I
was  sharing  his  story  with  la  migra  (i.e.,  the  immigration  authorities,
ICE). I assured him this was not the case and asked him to continue.
He would then resume his narrative, only to once again become preoc-
cupied with my intentions.

Pablo withdrew emotionally from me, and increasingly feared I would
sell him out to the authorities. I, in turn, had difficulty staying attuned to
him, becoming increasingly uncomfortable during our sessions. I increas-
ingly saw him as unnecessarily suspicious and disengaged, and I worried
that  the  stereotypes  of  ethnic  minorities  as  “unanalyzable,”  unable  to
engage in psychoanalytic therapy, were true (perhaps an ironic neurosis

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

159

considering that I am a Puerto Rican clinician who is also in his own per-
sonal  psychoanalytic  therapy!).  Through  supervision  and  reflection  on
the enactment, I realized that I was operating from an assumption that
belied my privilege as a Puerto Rican, because Puerto Ricans from the
island and the United States mainland are born with citizenship. Because
the mainland was always a plane ride away from Puerto Rico, I had no
idea what it was like to lose friends and family, and almost lose one’s life,
in the course of immigration. Hearing Pablo’s story highlighted the expe-
riential gulf between us, bringing my own unarticulated privileges into
awareness and increasing my discomfort. Pablo must have sensed this
discomfort and responded to it as a threat to his safety, a sign that I could
not provide a holding environment for his affect. When he rightly ques-
tioned whether I was compromising his safety (“are you reporting me to
la  migra? ”),  my  attempts  at  reassurance—the  denial  of  my  discomfort
with  our  cultural  difference—labeled  him  as  paranoid,  invalidating  his
experience of me in the here-and-now.

At  our  next  session  I  noted  the  growing  distance  between  us,  and
wondered aloud whether my “reassurance” had in fact invalidated him
and  implicitly  communicated  that  he  was  being  paranoid.  Pablo  con-
firmed this, sharing that he felt I was calling him a “Latino loco” (a crazy
Latino).  He  had  felt  confused  and  disoriented,  but  knew  that  at  some
level I was not fully present with him, which made him worry about my
intentions in listening to his trauma. I validated his observations of my
avoidance, and disclosed that I was reacting to the cultural differences in
our relationship: with him as an undocumented Latino and myself as—
at this point Pablo finished my sentence for me—“Latino con ciudadania”
(a  Latino  with  citizenship).  Bringing  attention  to  the  cultural  rupture
opened up space for us to address how our different experiences—his as
a Latin American immigrant, mine as a U.S.-born Puerto Rican—affected
our  interaction  and  my  ability  to  stay  connected.  The  enactment  reso-
nated with Pablo’s experience outside of therapy, in which others could
not understand the profundity of his immigration experience, or his fears
of being caught and “sent back” to his country by immigration officials.
Repairing the cultural rupture allowed for the restoration of mutual trust
by validating Pablo’s experience of me in the here-and-now. Validating
Pablo’s reality facilitated the emergence of underlying feelings of injury
and loss into awareness, allowing him to mourn those he had lost after
he immigrated to the United States. Expressing this untapped affect to me
provided Pablo with an experience in which his reality as a trauma victim

160

DANIEL J. GAZTAMBIDE, M.A., Psy.M.

was validated and born witness to. Mutual reflection on our transference
and countertransference, in turn, made new emotional and historical ma-
terial available to consciousness and furthered the work of analysis.

As a result of our exchange, I connected Pablo with an immigration
lawyer who did pro bono work and could inform him of his rights and
help him navigate the U.S. immigration system. Empowerment through
access to legal and community resources, coupled with increased coping
and  meaningful  connection  within  the  therapeutic  relationship,  led  to
symptom improvement, the creation of new meaning from the trauma,
and improvement in emotion regulation capacities. As set out at the be-
ginning of our time together, we reviewed our progress and assessed the
need for further treatment at the end of the school year. At this point,
Pablo felt he had achieved his goals and requested that we end treatment
so that he could attend to some family responsibilities that had come up.
After  a  collaborative  dialogue  we  decided  to  terminate  therapy  after  a
course of 25 sessions. The therapy process was marked by a dynamic
interplay  between  empathic  exploration  of  affect,  use  of  cognitive-be-
havioral skills training, here-and-now relational processing, and systems
level  intervention.  Technical  flexibility  allowed  us  to  deploy  different
types of clinical tools within a psychoanalytic framework.

conclusion:  Ferenczi’s  contribution  to  a
“Psychotherapy  for  the  People”

Governmental bureaucracy, combined with the ravaging effects of World
War I, prevented von Freund’s dream of starting the first psychoanalytic
free clinic in Budapest from becoming reality. Although Ferenczi was an
aggressive advocate for a free clinic, one was not to be established in
Hungary until the early 1930s. He blamed inadequate social services and
economic destitution not only for the delay of the clinic’s establishment,
but also for the lives lost to hopelessness and poverty. In 1929, he pub-
lished a case report, “From the Childhood of a Young Proletarian Girl,” a
clinical plea for social reform and increased awareness of the psychologi-
cal effects of poverty (cited in Danto, 2005).

The case report was the diary of a 19-year-old woman from an impov-
erished family, whose suicide Ferenczi was unable to prevent. The diary
chronicled  her  first  10  years  of  life,  describing  the  misery  she  experi-
enced as a result of her social class. Rendered powerless as a clinician in
the face of structural injustice, Ferenczi took the words of her diary to

 “A PSycHOTHEr APy  FOr  THE PEOPLE”

161

heart and tried to give her in death what she could not have in life: her
voice, reminiscent of his work with Rosa K,

Rich children are lucky. . . . They can learn many things, and [learning] is a
form of entertainment for them . . . and they are given chocolate if they
know  something.  Their  memory  is  not  burdened  with  all  the  horrible
things they cannot get rid of. The teacher treats them with artificial respect.
It was like this in our school. . . . I believe that many poor children learn
poorly or only moderately for similar reasons and not because they are less
talented. (quoted in Danto, 2005, p. 220)

Ferenczi’s  patient  spoke  truth  from  the  margins  of  psychoanalysis
then, and speaks truth from the margins of psychoanalysis today. Freud,
Ferenczi, and others struggled creatively to alloy pure gold and copper
and refine psychoanalysis into a metal that was more responsive to the
needs of those who do not have the time or the money for long-term,
open-ended, multiple-times-a-week analysis. These patients’ limitations
are not due to a lack of ego-strength, inability to tolerate frustration, or
any  such  ideologically  motivated  notions.  Ferenczi’s  “proletarian  girl”
exhibited  none  of  these.  She  displayed  a  keen  understanding  of  the
forces that underlay her trauma, and composed a striking indictment of
unjust conditions.

This article explores the historical importance of melding Freud’s gold
of psychoanalysis and the copper of less intensive psychotherapy to pro-
duce two important movements in contemporary psychoanalysis: Rela-
tional theory and short-term psychodynamic therapy. It does not argue,
however, that poor and oppressed communities somehow respond bet-
ter to these modalities, or that these should be the only options. In the
same way that I don’t see “traditional” psychoanalysis as the only way to
“do” psychoanalysis, I don’t wish for short-term therapy to become the
“new norm.” What makes the development of Relational psychoanalysis
and short-term dynamic therapy “psychotherapies for the people” is the
responsiveness that the early analysts—Freud, Rank, and Ferenczi among
them—employed to adapt their therapy and themselves to various condi-
tions and populations. What is important is not that the 1918 Budapest
speech fostered the growth of these approaches, but that it stirred the
flexibility necessary to alternate between long-term and short-term thera-
pies, or between “supportive” and “expressive” interventions. What we
need  to  realize  is  that  this  conversation  is  not  about  “psychoanalysis”
versus “something-not-psychoanalysis.” This is about different forms, al-

loys, permutations, flavors, and states: They are all psychoanalysis (Lew
Aron, personal communication; cf. Safran, 2009). The history of the early
analysts reveals that far from being apathetic to the needs of the poor,
they were responsive, reparative, and aware of the need for modification
and adaptation. It is this ethical impulse that can bring psychoanalysis to
the people. Following Ferenczi’s—and Freud’s—lead, we must commit
ourselves to an ethic of flexibility, and be prepared to tilt our ears to the
voices of others.

Strachey, J. (1912). Recommendations to Physicians Practising Psycho-Analysis. The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological
Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XII (1911-1913): The Case of Schreber, Papers on Technique and Other Works, 109-120

THE technical rules which I am putting forward here have been arrived at from my own experience in the course of many
years, after unfortunate results had led me to abandon other methods. It will easily be seen that they (or at least many of them)
may be summed up in a single precept. [Cf. p. 115.] My hope is that observance of them will spare physicians practising
analysis much unnecessary effort and guard them against some oversights. I must however make it clear that what I am
asserting is that this technique is the only one suited to my individuality; I do not venture to deny that a physician quite
differently constituted might find himself driven to adopt a different attitude to his patients and to the task before him.

(a) The first problem confronting an analyst who is treating more than one patient in the day will seem to him the hardest.

It is the task of keeping in mind all the innumerable names, dates, detailed memories and pathological products which each
patient communicates in the course of months and years of treatment, and of not confusing them with similar material produced
by other patients under treatment simultaneously or previously. If one is required to analyse six, eight, or even more patients
daily, the feat of memory involved in achieving this will provoke incredulity, astonishment or even commiseration in
uninformed observers. Curiosity will in any case be felt about the technique which makes it possible to master such an
abundance of material, and the expectation will be that some special expedients are required for the purpose.

The technique, however, is a very simple one. As we shall see, it rejects the use of any special expedient (even that of
taking notes). It consists simply in not directing one's notice to anything in particular and in maintaining the same ‘evenly-
suspended attention’ (as I have called it)  in the face of all that

 [The reference seems to be to a sentence in the case history of ‘Little Hans’ (1909b), Standard Ed., 10, 23, though the wording there is
slightly different. The present phrase occurs again later, in ‘Two Encyclopaedia Articles’ (1923a), Standard Ed., 18, 239.]

one hears. In this way we spare ourselves a strain on our attention which could not in any case be kept up for several

hours daily, and we avoid a danger which is inseparable from the exercise of deliberate attention. For as soon as anyone
deliberately concentrates his attention to a certain degree, he begins to select from the material before him; one point will be
fixed in his mind with particular clearness and some other will be correspondingly disregarded, and in making this selection he
will be following his expectations or inclinations. This, however, is precisely what must not be done. In making the selection, if
he follows his expectations he is in danger of never finding anything but what he already knows; and if he follows his
inclinations he will certainly falsify what he may perceive. It must not be forgotten that the things one hears are for the most
part things whose meaning is only recognized later on.

It will be seen that the rule of giving equal notice to everything is the necessary counterpart to the demand made on the

patient that he should communicate everything that occurs to him without criticism or selection. If the doctor behaves
otherwise, he is throwing away most of the advantage which results from the patient's obeying the ‘fundamental rule of
psychoanalysis’.  The rule for the doctor may be expressed: ‘He should withhold all conscious influences from his capacity to
attend, and give himself over completely to his “unconscious memory”.’ Or, to put it purely in terms of technique: ‘He should
simply listen, and not bother about whether he is keeping anything in mind.’

What is achieved in this manner will be sufficient for all requirements during the treatment. Those elements of the material
which already form a connected context will be at the doctor's conscious disposal; the rest, as yet unconnected and in chaotic
disorder, seems at first to be submerged, but rises readily into recollection as soon as the patient brings up something new to
which it can be related and by which it can be continued. The undeserved compliment of having ‘a remarkably good memory’
which the patient pays one when one reproduces some detail after a year and a day can then be accepted with a smile,

whereas a conscious determination to recollect the point would probably have resulted in failure.

Mistakes in this process of remembering occur only at times and places at which one is disturbed by some personal
consideration (see below [p. 116])—that is, when one has fallen seriously below the standard of an ideal analyst. Confusion
with material brought up by other patients occurs very rarely. Where there is a dispute with the patient as to whether or how he
1
has said some particular thing, the doctor is usually in the right.

(b) I cannot advise the taking of full notes, the keeping of a shorthand record, etc., during analytic sessions. Apart from
the unfavourable impression which this makes on some patients, the same considerations as have been advanced with regard
to attention apply here too.  A detrimental selection from the material will necessarily be made as one writes the notes or

2

shorthand, and part of one's own mental activity is tied up in this way, which would be better employed in interpreting what
one has heard. No objection can be raised to making exceptions to this rule in the case of dates, the text of dreams, or particular
noteworthy events which can easily be detached from their context and are suitable for independent use as instances.  But I
am not in the habit of doing this either. As regards instances, I write them down from memory in the evening after work is over;
as regards texts of dreams to which I attach importance, I get the patient to repeat them to me after he has related them so that I
can fix them in my mind.

 A patient will often assert that he has already told the doctor something on a previous occasion, while the doctor can assure him with a
quiet feeling of superiority that it has come up now for the first time. It then turns out that the patient had previously had the intention of
saying it, but had been prevented from performing his intention by a resistance which was still present. His recollection of his intention is
indistinguishable to him from a recollection of its performance. [Freud enlarged on this point not long afterwards in a short paper on
‘Fausse Reconnaissance’ occurring during analysis (1914a), Standard Ed., 13, 201.]

be justified by an intention of publishing a scientific study of the case. On general grounds this can scarcely be denied.
Nevertheless it must be borne in mind that exact reports of analytic case histories are of less value than might be expected.
Strictly speaking, they only possess the ostensible exactness of which ‘modern’ psychiatry affords us some striking examples.
They are, as a rule, fatiguing to the reader and yet do not succeed in being a substitute for his actual presence at an analysis.
Experience invariably shows that if readers are willing to believe an analyst they will have confidence in any slight revision to
which he has submitted his material; if, on the other hand, they are unwilling to take analysis and the analyst seriously, they
will pay no attention to accurate verbatim records of the treatment either. This is not the way, it seems, to remedy the lack of
convincing evidence to be found in psychoanalytic reports.

(d) One of the claims of psycho-analysis to distinction is, no doubt, that in its execution research and treatment coincide;
nevertheless, after a certain point, the technique required for the one opposes that required for the other. It is not a good thing
to work on a case scientifically while treatment is still proceeding—to piece together its structure, to try to foretell its further
progress, and to get a picture from time to time of the current state of affairs, as scientific interest would demand. Cases which
are devoted from the first to scientific purposes and are treated accordingly suffer in their outcome; while the most successful
cases are those in which one proceeds, as it were, without any purpose in view, allows oneself to be taken by surprise by any
new turn in them, and always meets them with an open mind, free from any presuppositions. The correct behaviour for an
analyst lies in swinging over according to need from the one mental attitude to the other, in avoiding speculation or brooding
over cases while they are in analysis, and in submitting the material obtained to a synthetic process of thought only after the
analysis is concluded. The distinction between the two attitudes would be meaningless if we already possessed all the
knowledge (or at least the essential knowledge) about the psychology of the unconscious and about the structure of the
neuroses that we can obtain from psychoanalytic work. At present we are still far from that goal and

we ought not to cut ourselves off from the possibility of testing what we have already learnt and of extending our knowledge
further.

(e) I cannot advise my colleagues too urgently to model themselves during psycho-analytic treatment on the surgeon, who

puts aside all his feelings, even his human sympathy, and concentrates his mental forces on the single aim of performing the
operation as skilfully as possible. Under present-day conditions the feeling that is most dangerous to a psycho-analyst is the
therapeutic ambition to achieve by this novel and much disputed method something that will produce a convincing effect upon

other people. This will not only put him into a state of mind which is unfavourable for his work, but will make him helpless
against certain resistances of the patient, whose recovery, as we know, primarily depends on the interplay of forces in him. The
justification for requiring this emotional coldness in the analyst is that it creates the most advantageous conditions for both
parties: for the doctor a desirable protection for his own emotional life and for the patient the largest amount of help that we can
give him to-day. A surgeon of earlier times took as his motto the words: ‘Je le pansai, Dieu le guérit.’  The analyst should be
content with something similar.

1

(f) It is easy to see upon what aim the different rules I have brought forward converge. [See p. 111.] They are all intended to

create for the doctor a counterpart to the ‘fundamental rule of psycho-analysis’ which is laid down for the patient. Just as the
patient must relate everything that his self-observation can detect, and keep back all the logical and affective objections that
seek to induce him to make a selection from among them, so the doctor must put himself in a position to make use of everything
he is told for the purposes of interpretation and of recognizing the concealed unconscious material without substituting a
censorship of his own for the selection that the patient has forgone. To put it in a formula: he must turn his own unconscious
like a receptive organ towards the transmitting unconscious of the patient. He must adjust himself to the patient as a telephone
receiver is adjusted to the transmitting

 [‘I dressed his wounds, God cured him.’ The saying is attributed to the French surgeon, Ambroise Paré (c. 1517-1590).]

microphone. Just as the receiver converts back into sound waves the electric oscillations in the telephone line which were set
up by sound waves, so the doctor's unconscious is able, from the derivatives of the unconscious which are communicated to
him, to reconstruct that unconscious, which has determined the patient's free associations.

But if the doctor is to be in a position to use his unconscious in this way as an instrument in the analysis, he must himself

fulfil one psychological condition to a high degree. He may not tolerate any resistances in himself which hold back from his
consciousness what has been perceived by his unconscious; otherwise he would introduce into the analysis a new species of
selection and distortion which would be far more detrimental than that resulting from concentration of conscious attention. It is
not enough for this that he himself should be an approximately normal person. It may be insisted, rather, that he should have
undergone a psycho-analytic purification and have become aware of those complexes of his own which would be apt to
interfere with his grasp of what the patient tells him. There can be no reasonable doubt about the disqualifying effect of such
defects in the doctor; every unresolved repression in him constitutes what has been aptly described by Stekel  as a ‘blind
spot’ in his analytic perception.

Some years ago I gave as an answer to the question of how one can become an analyst: ‘By analysing one's own
dreams.’  This preparation is no doubt enough for many people, but not for everyone who wishes to learn analysis. Nor can
everyone succeed in interpreting his own dreams without outside help. I count it as one of the many merits of the Zurich
school of analysis that they have laid increased emphasis on this requirement, and have embodied it in the demand that
everyone who wishes to carry out analyses on other people shall first himself undergo an analysis by someone with expert
knowledge. Anyone who takes up the work seriously should choose this course, which offers more than one advantage; the
sacrifice involved in laying oneself open to another person without being driven to

it by illness is amply rewarded. Not only is one's aim of learning to know what is hidden in one's own mind far more rapidly
attained and with less expense of affect, but impressions and convictions will be gained in relation to oneself which will be

sought in vain from studying books and attending lectures. And lastly, we must not under-estimate the advantage to be
1
derived from the lasting mental contact that is as a rule established between the student and his guide.

An analysis such as this of someone who is practically healthy will, as may be imagined, remain incomplete. Anyone who

can appreciate the high value of the self-knowledge and increase in self-control thus acquired will, when it is over, continue the
analytic examination of his personality in the form of a self-analysis, and be content to realize that, within himself as well as in
the external world, he must always expect to find something new. But anyone who has scorned to take the precaution of being
analysed himself will not merely be punished by being incapable of learning more than a certain amount from his patients, he
will risk a more serious danger and one which may become a danger to others. He will easily fall into the temptation of
projecting outwards some of the peculiarities of his own personality, which he has dimly perceived, into the field of science, as
a theory having universal validity; he will bring the psycho-analytic method into discredit, and lead the inexperienced astray.

(g) I shall now add a few other rules, that will serve as a transition from the attitude of the doctor to the treatment of the

patient.

Young and eager psycho-analysts will no doubt be tempted to bring their own individuality freely into the discussion, in

order to carry the patient along with them and lift him over the barriers of his own narrow personality. It might be expected that
it would be quite allowable and indeed useful, with a view to overcoming the patient's existing resistances, for the doctor to
afford him a glimpse of his own mental defects and conflicts and, by giving him intimate information about his own life,

 [See, however, a less optimistic view expressed in Section II of ‘Analysis Terminable and Interminable’ (1937c). That paper, one of the
very last of Freud's writings, touches at many other points (especially in Section VII) on the subject discussed in this and the next
paragraph.]

enable him to put himself on an equal footing. One confidence deserves another, and anyone who demands intimacy from
someone else must be prepared to give it in return.

But in psycho-analytic relations things often happen differently from what the psychology of consciousness might lead us

to expect. Experience does not speak in favour of an affective technique of this kind. Nor is it hard to see that it involves a
departure from psycho-analytic principles and verges upon treatment by suggestion. It may induce the patient to bring forward
sooner and with less difficulty things he already knows but would otherwise have kept back for a time through conventional
resistances. But this technique achieves nothing towards the uncovering of what is unconscious to the patient. It makes him
even more incapable of overcoming his deeper resistances, and in severer cases it invariably fails by encouraging the patient to
be insatiable: he would like to reverse the situation, and finds the analysis of the doctor more interesting than his own. The
resolution of the transference, too—one of the main tasks of the treatment—is made more difficult by an intimate attitude on
the doctor's part, so that any gain there may be at the beginning is more than outweighed at the end. I have no hesitation,
therefore, in condemning this kind of technique as incorrect. The doctor should be opaque to his patients and, like a mirror,
should show them nothing but what is shown to him. In practice, it is true, there is nothing to be said against a psychotherapist
combining a certain amount of analysis with some suggestive influence in order to achieve a perceptible result in a shorter time
—as is necessary, for instance, in institutions. But one has a right to insist that he himself should be in no doubt about what he
is doing and should know that his method is not that of true psycho-analysis.

(h) Another temptation arises out of the educative activity which, in psycho-analytic treatment, devolves on the doctor

without any deliberate intention on his part. When the developmental inhibitions are resolved, it happens of itself that the
doctor finds himself in a position to indicate new aims for the trends that have been liberated. It is then no more than a natural
ambition if he endeavours to make something specially excellent of a person whom he has been at such pains to free from his
neurosis and if he prescribes high aims for his wishes.

But here again the doctor should hold himself in check, and take the patient's capacities rather than his own desires as

guide. Not every neurotic has a high talent for sublimation; one can assume of many of them that they would not have fallen ill
at all if they had possessed the art of sublimating their instincts. If we press them unduly towards sublimation and cut them off
from the most accessible and convenient instinctual satisfactions, we shall usually make life even harder for them than they feel
it in any case. As a doctor, one must above all be tolerant to the weakness of a patient, and must be content if one has won
back some degree of capacity for work and enjoyment for a person even of only moderate worth. Educative ambition is of as
little use as therapeutic ambition. It must further be borne in mind that many people fall ill precisely from an attempt to sublimate
their instincts beyond the degree permitted by their organization and that in those who have a capacity for sublimation the
process usually takes place of itself as soon as their inhibitions have been overcome by analysis. In my opinion, therefore,
efforts invariably to make use of the analytic treatment to bring about sublimation of instinct are, though no doubt always
laudable, far from being in every case advisable.

(i) To what extent should the patient's intellectual co-operation be sought for in the treatment? It is difficult to say
anything of general applicability on this point: the patient's personality is the determining factor. But in any case caution and
self-restraint must be observed in this connection. It is wrong to set a patient tasks, such as collecting his memories or thinking
over some particular period of his life. On the contrary, he has to learn above all—what never comes easily to anyone—that
mental activities such as thinking something over or concentrating the attention solve none of the riddles of a neurosis; that
can only be done by patiently obeying the psycho-analytic rule, which enjoins the exclusion of all criticism of the unconscious
or of its derivatives. One must be especially unyielding about obedience to that rule with patients who practise the art of
sheering off into intellectual discussion during their treatment, who speculate a great deal and often very wisely about their
condition and in that way avoid doing anything to overcome it. For this reason I dislike making use of analytic

writings as an assistance to my patients; I require them to learn by personal experience, and I assure them that they will acquire
wider and more valuable knowledge than the whole literature of psycho-analysis could teach them. I recognize, however, that
under institutional conditions it may be of great advantage to employ reading as a preparation for patients in analysis and as a
means of creating an atmosphere of influence.

I must give a most earnest warning against any attempt to gain the confidence or support of parents or relatives by giving

them psycho-analytic books to read, whether of an introductory or an advanced kind. This well-meant step usually has the
effect of bringing on prematurely the natural opposition of the relatives to the treatment—an opposition which is bound to
appear sooner or later—so that the treatment is never even begun.

Let me express a hope that the increasing experience of psycho-analysts will soon lead to agreement on questions of
technique and on the most effective method of treating neurotic patients. As regards the treatment of their relatives I must
confess myself utterly at a loss, and I have in general little faith in any individual treatment of them.

Instincts and their Vicissitudes

Sigmund Freud

WE have often heard it maintained that sciences should be built up on clear and sharply
defined basic concepts. In actual fact no science, not even the most exact, begins with such
definitions. The true beginning of scientific activity consists rather in describing phenomena
and then in proceeding to group, classify and correlate them. Even at the stage of description
it is not possible to avoid applying certain abstract ideas to the material in hand, ideas derived
from somewhere or other but certainly not from the new observations alone. Such ideas—
which will later become the basic concepts of the science—are still more indispensable as
the material is further worked over. They must at first necessarily possess some degree of
indefiniteness; there can be no question of any clear delimitation of their content. So long as
they remain in this condition, we come to an understanding about their meaning by making
repeated references to the material of observation from which they appear to have been
derived, but upon which, in fact, they have been imposed. Thus, strictly speaking, they are in
the nature of conventions—although everything depends on their not being arbitrarily chosen
but determined by their having significant relations to the empirical material, relations that we
seem to sense before we can clearly recognize and demonstrate them. It is only after more
thorough investigation of the field of observation that we are able to formulate its basic
scientific concepts with increased precision, and progressively so to modify them that they
become serviceable and consistent over a wide area. Then, indeed, the time may have come to
confine them in definitions. The advance of knowledge, however, does not tolerate any
rigidity even in definitions. Physics furnishes an excellent illustration of the way in which
even ‘basic concepts’ that have been established in the form of definitions are
constantly being altered in their content.1

A conventional basic concept of this kind, which at the

moment is still somewhat obscure but which is indispensable to us in psychology, is that of an
‘instinct’.1 Let us try to give a content to it by approaching it from different angles.

First, from the angle of physiology. This has given us the concept of a ‘stimulus’ and the

pattern of the reflex arc, according to which a stimulus applied to living tissue (nervous
substance) from the outside is discharged by action to the outside. This action is expedient in
so far as it withdraws the stimulated substance from the influence of the stimulus, removes it
out of its range of operation.

What is the relation of ‘instinct’ to ‘stimulus’? There is nothing to prevent our subsuming

the concept of ‘instinct’ under that of ‘stimulus’ and saying that aninstinct is a stimulus
applied to the mind. But we are immediately set on our guard against equating instinct and

mental stimulus. There are obviously other stimuli to the mind besides those of an instinctual
kind, stimuli which behave far more like physiological ones. For example, when a strong light
falls on the eye, it is not an instinctual stimulus; it is one, however, when a dryness of the
mucous membrane of the pharynx or an irritation of the mucous membrane of the stomach
makes itself felt.2

We have now obtained the material necessary for distinguishing between instinctual

stimuli and other (physiological) stimuli that operate on the mind. In the first place, an
instinctual stimulus does not arise from the external world but from within the organism itself.
For this reason it operates differently upon the mind and different actions are necessary in
order to remove it. Further, all that is essential in a stimulus is covered if we assume that it
operates with a single impact, so that it can be disposed of by a single expedient action. A
typical instance of this is motor flight from the source of stimulation. These impacts may, of
course, be repeated and summated, but that makes no difference to our notion of the process
and to the conditions for the removal of the stimulus. An instinct, on the other hand, never
operates as a force giving a momentary impact but always as a constant one. Moreover, since
it impinges not from without but from within the organism, no flight can avail against it. A
better term for an instinctual stimulus is a

2 Assuming, of course, that these internal processes are the organic basis of the respective
needs of thirst and hunger.

‘need’. What does away with a need is ‘satisfaction’. This can be attained only by an
appropriate (‘adequate’) alteration of the internal source of stimulation.

Let us imagine ourselves in the situation of an almost entirely helpless living organism, as

yet unorientated in the world, which is receiving stimuli in its nervous substance.1 This
organism will very soon be in a position to make a first distinction and a first orientation. On
the one hand, it will be aware of stimuli which can be avoided by muscular action (flight);
these it ascribes to an external world. On the other hand, it will also be aware of stimuli
against which such action is of no avail and whose character of constant pressure persists in
spite of it; these stimuli are the signs of an internal world, the evidence of instinctual needs.
The perceptual substance of the living organism will thus have found in the efficacy of its
muscular activity a basis for distinguishing between an ‘outside’ and an ‘inside’.2

We thus arrive at the essential nature of instincts in the first place by considering their
main characteristics—their origin in sources of stimulation within the organism and their
appearance as a constant force—and from this we deduce one of their further features,
namely, that no actions of flight avail against them. In the course of this discussion, however,
we cannot fail to be struck by something that obliges us to make a further admission. In order
to guide us in dealing with the field of psychological phenomena, we do not merely apply
certain conventions to our empirical material as basic concepts; we also

1 [The hypothesis which follows concerning the behaviour of a primitive living organism, and
the postulation of a fundamental ‘principle of constancy’, had been stated in similar terms in
some of the very earliest of Freud's psychological works. See, for instance, Chapter VII,
Sections C and E, of The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a), Standard Ed., 5, 565 ff.
and 598ff. But it had been expressed still earlier in neurological terms in his posthumously
published ‘Project’ of 1895 (1950a, Part I, Section 1), as well as, more briefly, in his lecture
on the Breuer and Freud ‘Preliminary Communication’ (1893h) and in the penultimate
paragraph of his French paper on hysterical paralyses (1893c). Freud returned to the
hypothesis once more, in Chapters I and IV of Beyond the Pleasure
Principle (1920g), Standard Ed., 18, 1 ff. and 26 ff.; and reconsidered it in
‘The Economic Problem of Masochism’ (1924c). Cf. footnote, p. 121 below.]

make use of a number of complicated postulates. We have already alluded to the most
important of these, and all we need now do is to state it expressly. This postulate is of a
biological nature, and makes use of the concept of ‘purpose’ (or perhaps of expediency) and
runs as follows: the nervous system is an apparatus which has the function of getting rid of
the stimuli that reach it, or of reducing them to the lowest possible level; or which, if it were
feasible, would maintain itself in an altogether unstimulated condition.1 Let us for the present
not take exception to the indefiniteness of this idea and let us assign to the nervous system the
task—speaking in general terms—of mastering stimuli. We then see how greatly the simple
pattern of the physiological reflex is complicated by the introduction of instincts. External
stimuli impose only the single task of withdrawing from them; this is accomplished by
muscular movements, one of which eventually achieves that aim and thereafter,being the
expedient movement, becomes a hereditary disposition. Instinctual stimuli, which originate
from within the organism, cannot be dealt with by this mechanism. Thus they make far higher
demands on the nervous system and cause it to undertake involved and interconnected
activities by which the external world is so changed as to afford satisfaction to the internal
source of stimulation. Above all, they oblige the nervous system to renounce
its ideal intention of keeping off stimuli, for they maintain an incessant and unavoidable
afflux of stimulation. We may therefore well conclude that instincts and not external stimuli
are the true motive forces behind the advances that have led the nervous system, with its
unlimited capacities, to its present high level of development. There is naturally nothing to
prevent our supposing that the instincts themselves are, at least in part, precipitates of the
effects of external stimulation, which in the course of phylogenesis have brought about
modifications in the living substance.

When we further find that the activity of even the most highly developed mental
apparatus is subject to the pleasure principle, i.e. is automatically regulated by feelings
belonging to the pleasure-unpleasure series, we can hardly reject the further hypothesis that
these feelings reflect the manner in which the process of mastering stimuli takes place—
certainly in the sense that unpleasurable feelings are connected with an increase

and pleasurable feelings with a decrease of stimulus. We will, however, carefully preserve
this assumption in its present highly indefinite form, until we succeed, if that is possible, in
discovering what sort of relation exists between pleasure and unpleasure, on the one hand,
and fluctuations in the amounts of stimulus affecting mental life, on the other. It is certain that
many very various relations of this kind, and not very simple ones, are possible.1

If now we apply ourselves to considering mental life from a biological point of view, an

‘instinct’ appears to us as a concept

1 [It will be seen that two principles are here involved. One of these is the ‘principle of
constancy’ (see above, p. 120, and footnote 1, p. 119). It is stated again in Beyond the
Pleasure Principle, 1920g, Chapter I (Standard Ed., 18, 59), as follows: ‘The mental
apparatus endeavours to keep the quantity of excitation present in it as low as possible or at
least to keep it constant.’ For this principle Freud, in the same work (Standard Ed., 56),
adopted the term ‘Nirvana principle’. The second principle involved is the
‘pleasure principle’, stated at the beginning of the paragraph to which this note is appended.
It, too, is restated in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Standard Ed., 7): ‘The course taken by
mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle.… [That course] takes a
direction such that its final outcome coincides with … an avoidance of unpleasure or a
production of pleasure.’ Freud seems to have assumed to begin with that these two principles
were closely correlated and even identical. Thus, in his ‘Project’ of 1895 (Freud, 1950a, Part
I, Section 8) he writes: ‘Since we have certain knowledge of a trend in psychical life towards
avoiding unpleasure, we are tempted to identify that trend with the primary trend towards
inertia [i.e. towards avoidingexcitation].’ A similar view is taken in Chapter VII (E) of The
Interpretation of Dreams (1900a), Standard Ed., 5, 598. In the passage in the text above,
however, a doubt appears to be expressed as to the completeness of the correlation between
the two principles. This doubt is carried farther in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Standard
Ed., 18, 8 and 63) and is discussed at some length in ‘The Economic Problem
of Masochism’ (1924c). Freud there argues that the two principles cannot be identical, since
there are unquestionably states of increasing tension which are pleasurable (e.g. sexual
excitement), and he goes on to suggest (what had already been hinted at in the two passages
in Beyond the Pleasure Principle just referred to) that the pleasurable or unpleasurable quality
of a state may be related to a temporal characteristic (or rhythm) of the changes in the
quantity of excitation present. He concludes that in any case the two principles must not be
regarded as identical: the pleasure principle is a modification of the Nirvana principle.
The Nirvana principle, he maintains, is to be attributed to the ‘death instinct’, and its
modification into the pleasure principle is due to the influence of the ‘life instinct’ or libido.]

on the frontier between the mental and the somatic, as the psychical representative of the
stimuli originating from within the organism and reaching the mind, as a measure of
the demand made upon the mind for work in consequence of its connection with the body.1

We are now in a position to discuss certain terms which are used in reference to the
concept of an instinct—for example, its ‘pressure’, its ‘aim’, its ‘object’ and its ‘source’.

By the pressure [Drang] of an instinct we understand its motor factor, the amount of force

or the measure of the demand for work which it represents. The characteristic of
exercising pressure is common to all instincts; it is in fact their very essence. Every instinct is
a piece of activity; if we speak loosely of passive instincts, we can only
mean instincts whose aim is passive.2

The aim [Ziel] of an instinct is in every instance satisfaction, which can only be obtained

by removing the state of stimulation at the source of the instinct. But although the ultimate
aim of each instinct remains unchangeable, there may yet be different paths leading to the
same ultimate aim; so that an instinct may be found to have various nearer or intermediate
aims, which are combined or interchanged with one another. Experience permits us also to
speak of instincts which are ‘inhibited in their aim’, in the case of processes which are
allowed to make some advance towards instinctual satisfaction but are then inhibited or
deflected. We may suppose that even processes of this kind involve a partial satisfaction.

The object [Objekt] of an instinct is the thing in regard to which or through which
the instinct is able to achieve its aim. It is what is most variable about an instinctand is not
originally connected with it, but becomes assigned to it only in consequence
of being peculiarly fitted to make satisfaction possible. The object is not necessarily
something extraneous: it may equally well be a part of the subject's own body. It may be

Adler for misunderstanding this ‘pressing’ characteristic of instincts appears at the end of the
second Section of Part III of the ‘Little Hans’ analysis (1909b), Standard Ed., 10, 140-1.]

changed any number of times in the course of the vicissitudes which the instinct undergoes
during its existence; and highly important parts are played by thisdisplacement of instinct. It
may happen that the same object serves for the satisfaction of
several instincts simultaneously, a phenomenon which Adler [1908] has called a ‘confluence’
of instincts [Triebverschränkung].1 A particularly close attachment of the instinct to its object
is distinguished by the term ‘fixation’. This frequently occurs at very early periods of
the development of an instinct and puts an end to its mobility through its intense opposition to
detachment.2

By the source [Quelle] of an instinct is meant the somatic process which occurs in an
organ or part of the body and whose stimulus is represented in mental life by an instinct. We
do not know whether this process is invariably of a chemical nature or whether it may also
correspond to the release of other, e.g. mechanical, forces. The study of the sources
of instincts lies outside the scope of psychology. Although instincts are wholly determined by
their origin in a somatic source, in mental life we know them only by their aims. An
exact knowledge of the sources of an instinct is not invariably necessary for purposes of
psychological investigation; sometimes its source may be inferred from its aim.

Are we to suppose that the different instincts which originate in the body and operate on

the mind are also distinguished by different qualities, and that that is why they behave in
qualitatively different ways in mental life? This supposition does not seem to be justified; we
are much more likely to find the simpler assumption sufficient—that the instincts are all
qualitatively alike and owe the effect they make only to the amount of excitation they carry,
or perhaps, in addition, to certain functions of that quantity. What distinguishes from one
another the mental effects produced by the various instincts may be traced to the difference in
their sources. In any event, it is only in a later connection that we shall be able to make plain
what the problem of the quality of instincts signifies.3

What instincts should we suppose there are, and how many?

There is obviously a wide opportunity here for arbitrary choice. No objection can be made to
anyone's employing the concept of an instinct of play or of destruction or of gregariousness,
when the subject-matter demands it and the limitations of psychological analysis allow of it.
Nevertheless, we should not neglect to ask ourselves whether instinctual motives like these,
which are so highly specialized on the one hand, do not admit of further dissection in
accordance with the sources of the instinct, so that only primal instincts—those which cannot
be further dissected—can lay claim to importance.

I have proposed that two groups of such primal instincts should be distinguished: the ego,

or self-preservative, instincts and the sexual instincts. But this supposition has not the status
of a necessary postulate, as has, for instance, our assumption about the biological purpose of
the mental apparatus (p. 120); it is merely a working hypothesis, to be retained only so long as
it proves useful, and it will make little difference to the results of our work of description and
classification if it is replaced by another. The occasion for this hypothesis arose in the course
of the evolution of psycho-analysis, which was first employed upon the psychoneuroses, or,
more precisely, upon the group described as ‘transference neuroses’ (hysteria and obsessional
neurosis); these showed that at the root of all such affections there is to be found
a conflict between the claims of sexuality and those of the ego. It is always possible that an
exhaustive study of the other neurotic affections (especially of the narcissistic
psychoneuroses, the schizophrenias) may oblige us to alter this formula and to make a
different classification of the primal instincts. But for the present we do not know of any such
formula, nor have we met with any argument unfavourable to drawing this contrast between
sexual and ego-instincts.1

I am altogether doubtful whether any decisive pointers for the differentiation and

classification of the instincts can be arrived at on the basis of working over the
psychological material. This working-over seems rather itself to call for the application to
the material of definite assumptions concerning instinctual life, and it would be a desirable

thing if those assumptions could be taken from some other branch of knowledge and carried
over to psychology. The contribution which biology has to

- 124 -

make here certainly does not run counter to the distinction between sexual and ego-instincts.
Biology teaches that sexuality is not to be put on a par with other functions of the individual;
for its purposes go beyond the individual and have as their content the production of new
individuals—that is, the preservation of the species. It shows, further, that two views,
seemingly equally well-founded, may be taken of the relation between the ego and sexuality.
On the one view, the individual is the principal thing, sexuality is one of its activities and
sexual satisfaction one of its needs; while on the other view the individual is a temporary and
transient appendage to the quasi-immortal germ-plasm, which is entrusted to him by the
process of generation.1 The hypothesis that the sexual function differs
from other bodily processes in virtue of a special chemistry is, I understand, also a postulate
of the Ehrlich school of biological research.2

Since a study of instinctual life from the direction of consciousness presents almost
insuperable difficulties, the principal source of our knowledge remains the psycho-analytic
investigation of mental disturbances. Psycho-analysis, however, in consequence of the course
taken by its development, has hitherto been able to give us information of a fairly satisfactory
nature only about the sexual instincts; for it is precisely that group which alone can be
observed in isolation, as it were, in the psychoneuroses. With the extension of psycho-
analysis to the other neurotic affections, we shall no doubt find a basis for our knowledge of
the ego-instincts as well, though it would be rash to expect equally favourable conditions for
observation in this further field of research.

This much can be said by way of a general characterization of the sexual instincts. They

are numerous, emanate from a great variety of organic sources, act in the first instance
independently of one another and only achieve a more or less complete synthesis at a
late stage. The aim which each of them

Essays (1905d), Standard Ed., 7, 216 n. But he had held it for at least ten years previously.

strives for is the attainment of‘organ-pleasure’1 only when synthesis is achieved do they enter
the service of the reproductive function and thereupon become generally recognizable as
sexual instincts. At their first appearance they are attached to the instincts of self-preservation,
from which they only gradually become separated; in their choice of object, too, they follow

the paths that are indicated to them by the ego-instincts.2 A portion of them remains
associated with the ego-instincts throughout life and furnishes them with libidinal
components, which in normal functioning easily escape notice and are revealed clearly only
by the onset of illness.3 They are distinguished by possessing the capacity to act vicariously
for one another to a wide extent and by being able to change their objects readily. In
consequence of the latter properties they are capable of functions which are far removed from
their original purposive actions—capable, that is, of ‘sublimation’.

Our inquiry into the various vicissitudes which instincts undergo in the process

of development and in the course of life must be confined to the sexual instincts, which are
the more familiar to us. Observation shows us that an instinct may undergo the following
vicissitudes:—

Reversal into its opposite.

Turning round upon the subject's own self.

Repression.

Sublimation.

Since I do not intend to treat of sublimation here4 and since repression requires a special
chapter to itself [cf. next paper, p. 146], it only remains for us to describe and discuss the two
first points. Bearing in mind that there are motive forces which

here for the first time by Freud. The term is discussed at greater length in the early part of

these vicissitudes as modes of defence against the instincts.

different processes: a change from activity to passivity, and a reversal of its content. The
two processes, being different in their nature, must be treated separately

Examples of the first process are met with in the two pairs of opposites: sadism—

masochism and scopophilia—exhibitionism. The reversal affects only the aims of
the instincts. The active aim (to torture, to look at) is replaced by the passive aim (to be
tortured, to be looked at). Reversal of content is found in the single instance of
the transformation of love into hate.

The turning round of an instinct upon the subject's own self is made plausible by the
reflection that masochism is actually sadism turned round upon the subject's own ego, and

that exhibitionism includes looking at his own body. Analytic observation, indeed, leaves us
in no doubt that the masochist shares in the enjoyment of the assault upon himself, and that
the exhibitionist shares in the enjoyment of [the sight of] his exposure. The essence of the
process is thus the change of the object, while the aim remains unchanged. We cannot fail to
notice, however, that in these examples the turning round upon the subject's self and
the transformation from activity topassivity converge or coincide.

To elucidate the situation, a more thorough investigation is essential.

In the case of the pair of opposites sadism—masochism, the process may be represented

as follows:

(a) Sadism consists in the exercise of violence or power upon some other person as

object.

(b) This object is given up and replaced by the subject's self. With the turning round
upon the self the change from an active to a passive instinctual aim is also
effected.

(c) An extraneous person is once more sought as object; this person, in consequence
of the alteration which has taken place in the instinctual aim, has to take over the
role of the subject.1

1 [Though the general sense of these passages is clear, there may be some confusion in the
use of the word ‘subject’. As a rule ‘subject’ and ‘object’ are used respectively for the person
in whom an instinct (or other state of mind) originates, and the person or thing to which it is
directed. Here, however, ‘subject’ seems to be used for the person who plays the activepart in
the relationship—the agent. The word is more obviously used in this sense in the parallel
passage on p. 129 and elsewhere below.]

Case (c) is what is commonly termed masochism. Here, too, satisfaction follows along the

path of the original sadism, the passive ego placing itself back in phantasyin its first role,
which has now in fact been taken over by the extraneous subject.1 Whether there is, besides
this, a more direct masochistic satisfaction is highly doubtful. A primary masochism, not
derived from sadism in the manner I have described, seems not to be met with.2 That it is not
superfluous to assume the existence ofstage (b) is to be seen from the behaviour of the
sadistic instinct in obsessional neurosis. There there is a turning round upon the subject's
self without an attitude ofpassivity towards another person: the change has only got as far
as stage (b). The desire to torture has turned into self-torture and self-punishment, not
into masochism. The active voice is changed, not into the passive, but into the reflexive,
middle voice.3

Our view of sadism is further prejudiced by the circumstance that this instinct, side by

side with its general aim (or perhaps, rather, within it), seems to strive towards the
accomplishment of a quite special aim—not only to humiliate and master, but, in addition, to
inflict pains. Psycho-analysis would appear to show that the infliction of pain plays no part
among the original purposive actions of the instinct. A sadistic child takes no account of
whether or not he inflicts pains, nor does he intend to do so. But when once
the transformation into masochism has taken place, the pains are very well fitted to provide a

passive masochistic aim; for we have every reason to believe that sensations of pain,
like other unpleasurable sensations, trench upon sexual excitation and produce a pleasurable
condition, for the sake of which the subject will even willingly experience the unpleasure of
pain.4 When once feeling pains has become a masochistic aim, the sadistic aim
of causing pains can arise also,

retrogressively; for while these pains are being inflicted on other people, they are enjoyed
masochistically by the subject through his identification of himself with the suffering object.
In both cases, of course, it is not the pain itself which is enjoyed, but the accompanying
sexual excitation—so that this can be done especially conveniently from the sadistic position.
The enjoyment of pain would thus be an aim which was originally masochistic, but which can
only become an instinctual aim in someone who was originally sadistic.

For the sake of completeness I may add that feelings of pity cannot be described as a

result of a transformation of instinct occurring in sadism, but necessitate the notion of
a reaction-formation against that instinct. (For the difference, see later.)1

Rather different and simpler findings are afforded by the investigation of another pair of

opposites—the instincts whose respective aim is to look and to display oneself
(scopophilia and exhibitionism, in the language of the perversions). Here again we may
postulate the same stages as in the previous instance:—(a) Looking as anactivity directed
towards an extraneous object. (b) Giving up of the object and turning of the
scopophilic instinct towards a part of the subject's own body; with
this,transformation to passivity and setting up of a new aim—that of being looked at. (c)
Introduction of a new subject2 to whom one displays oneself in order to be looked at by him.
Here, too, it can hardly be doubted that the active aim appears before the passive, that looking
precedes being looked at. But there is an important divergence from what happens in the case
of sadism, in that we can recognize in the case of the

1 [It is not clear to what passage this is intended to refer, unless, again, it was included in a
missing paper on sublimation. There is in fact some discussion of the subject in ‘Thoughts for
the Times on War and Death’ (1915b), p. 281 below. But this cannot have been what Freud
had in mind, for it was originally published in a different volume. In a footnote added in 1915
(the year in which the present paper was written) to the Three Essays (1905d), Freud insists
that sublimation and reaction-formation are to be regarded as distinct processes(Standard
Ed., 7, 178 n.).—The German word for ‘pity’ is ‘Mitleid’, literally ‘suffering with’,

‘compassion’. Another view of the origin of the feeling is expressed in the ‘Wolf
Man’analysis (1918b), Standard Ed., 17, 88, which was actually written, in all probability, at
the end of 1914, a few months earlier than the present paper.]

scopophilic instinct a yet earlier stage than that described as (a). For the beginning of
its activity the scopophilic instinct is auto-erotic: it has indeed an object, but that object is part
of the subject's own body. It is only later that the instinct is led, by a process of comparison,
to exchange this object for an analogous part of someone else's body—stage (a). This
preliminary stage is interesting because it is the source of both the situations represented in
the resulting pair of opposites, the one or theother according to which element in the original
situation is changed. The following might serve as a diagrammatic picture of the
scopophilic instinct:—

A preliminary stage of this kind is absent in sadism, which from the outset is directed
upon an extraneous object, although it might not be altogether unreasonable to construct such
a stage out of the child's efforts to gain control over his own limbs.1

With regard to both the instincts which we have just taken as examples, it should be
remarked that their transformation by a reversal from activity to passivity and by a turning
round upon the subject never in fact involves the whole quota of the instinctual impulse. The
earlier active direction of the instinct persists to some degree side by side with its later passive
direction, even when the process of its transformation has been very extensive. The only
correct statement to make about the scopophilic instinct would be that all the stages of
its development, its auto-erotic, preliminary stage as well as its final active or passive form,
co-exist alongside one another; and the truth of this becomes obvious if we base our opinion,
not on the actions to which the instinct leads, but on the mechanism of its satisfaction.
Perhaps, however, it is permissible to look at the matter

and represent it in yet another way. We can divide the life of each instinct into a series of
separate successive waves, each of which is homogeneous during whatever period of time it
may last, and whose relation to one another is comparable to that of successive eruptions of

lava. We can then perhaps picture the first, original eruption of the instinct as proceeding in
an unchanged form and undergoing no development at all. The next wave would be modified
from the outset—being turned, for instance, from active to passive—and would then, with this
new characteristic, be added to the earlier wave, and so on. If we were then to take a survey of
the instinctual impulse from its beginning up to a given point, the succession of waves which
we have described would inevitably present the picture of a definite development of
theinstinct.

The fact that, at this1 later period of development of an instinctual impulse, its (passive)

opposite may be observed alongside of it deserves to be marked by the very apt term
introduced by Bleuler—‘ambivalence’.2

This reference to the developmental history of instincts and the permanence of their

intermediate stages should make the development of instincts fairly intelligible to us.
Experience shows that the amount of demonstrable ambivalence varies greatly between
individuals, groups and races. Marked instinctual ambivalence in a humanbeing living at the
present day may be regarded as an archaic inheritance, for we have reason to suppose that the
part played in instinctual life by the active impulses in their unmodified form was greater in
primaeval times than it is on an average to-day.3

We have become accustomed to call the early phase of the

2 [The term ‘ambivalence’, coined by Bleuler (1910b, and 1911, 43 and 305), seems not to
have been used by him in this sense. He distinguished three kinds of ambivalence: (1)
emotional, i.e. oscillation between love and hate, (2) voluntary, i.e. inability to decide on
an action, and (3) intellectual, i.e. belief in contradictory propositions. Freud generally uses
the term in the first of these senses. See, for instance, the first occasion on which he seems to
have adopted it, near the end of his paper on ‘The Dynamics of Transference’ (1912b), and
later in the present paper (pp. 133 and 139). The passage in the text is one of the few in which
he has applied the term to activity and passivity. For another instance of this exceptional use
see a passage in Section III of the ‘Wolf Man’ case history (1918b), Standard Ed., 17, 26.]

3 [See Totem and Taboo (1912-13), Standard Ed., 13, 66.]

development of the ego, during which its sexual instincts find auto-erotic satisfaction,
‘narcissism’, without at once entering on any discussion of the relation between auto-erotism
and narcissism. It follows that the preliminary stage of the scopophilic instinct, in which the
subject's own body is the object of the scopophilia, must be classed under narcissism, and that
we must describe it as a narcissistic formation. The active scopophilic instinct develops from
this, by leaving narcissism behind. The passive scopophilic instinct, on the contrary, holds
fast to the narcissistic object. Similarly, the transformation of sadism into masochism implies
a return to the narcissistic object. And in both these cases [i.e. in
passive scopophilia and masochism] the narcissistic subject is, through identification,
replaced by another, extraneous ego. If we take into account our constructed preliminary
narcissistic stage of sadism, we shall be approaching a more general realization—namely, that
the instinctual vicissitudes which consist in the instinct's being turned round upon the

subject's own ego and undergoing reversal from activity to passivity are dependent on the
narcissistic organization of the ego and bear the stamp of that phase. They perhaps correspond
to the attempts at defence which at higher stages of thedevelopment of the ego are effected
by other means. [See above, pp. 126-7.]

At this point we may call to mind that so far we have considered only two pairs of
opposite instincts: sadism—masochism and scopophilia—exhibitionism. These are the best
known sexual instincts that appear in an ambivalent manner. The other components of the
later sexual function are not yet sufficiently accessible to analysisfor us to be able to discuss
them in a similar way. In general we can assert of them that their activities are auto-
erotic; that is to say, their object is negligible in comparison with the organ which is their
source, and as a rule coincides with that organ. The object of the scopophilic instinct,
however, though it too is in the first instance a part of the subject's own body, is not the eye
itself; and in sadism the organic source, which is probably the muscular apparatus with its
capacity for action, points unequivocally at an object other than itself, even though that object
is part of the subject's own body. In the auto-erotic instincts, the part played by the organic
source is so decisive that, according to a plausible suggestion of Federn (1913) and
Jekels (1913), the form and

function of the organ determine the activity or passivity of the instinctual aim.

The change of the content [cf. p. 127] of an instinct into its opposite is observed in a
single instance only—the transformation of love into hate.1 Since it is particularly common to
find both these directed simultaneously towards the same object, their co-existence furnishes
the most important example of ambivalence of feeling. [See p. 131 n. 2.]

The case of love and hate acquires a special interest from the circumstance that it refuses

to be fitted into our scheme of the instincts. It is impossible to doubt that there is the most
intimate relation between these two opposite feelings and sexual life, but we are naturally
unwilling to think of love as being some kind of specialcomponent instinct of sexuality in the
same way as the others we have been discussing. We should prefer to regard loving as the
expression of the whole sexual current of feeling; but this idea does not clear up our
difficulties, and we cannot see what meaning to attach to an opposite content of this current.

Loving admits not merely of one, but of three opposites. In addition to the antithesis
‘loving—hating’, there is the other one of ‘loving—being loved’; and, in addition to these,
loving and hating taken together are the opposite of the condition of unconcern
or indifference. The second of these three antitheses, loving—beingloved, corresponds
exactly to the transformation from activity to passivity and may be traced to an underlying
situation in the same way as in the case of the scopophilicinstinct. This situation is that
of loving oneself, which we regard as the characteristic feature of narcissism. Then, according
as the object or the subject is replaced by an extraneous one, what results is the active aim of
loving or the passive one of being loved—the latter remaining near to narcissism.

Perhaps we shall come to a better understanding of the several opposites of loving if we

reflect that our mental life as a whole is governed by three polarities, the antitheses

Subject (ego)—Object (external world),

Pleasure—Unpleasure, and

Active—Passive.

The antithesis ego—non-ego (external), i.e. subject—object, is, as we have already said
[p. 119], thrust upon the individual organism at an early stage, by the experience that it can
silence external stimuli by means of muscular action but is defenceless
against instinctual stimuli. This antithesis remains, above all, sovereign in our
intellectual activity and creates for research the basic situation which no efforts can alter. The
polarity of pleasure—unpleasure is attached to a scale of feelings, whose paramount
importance in determining our actions (our will) has already been emphasized [pp. 120-1].
The antithesis active—passive must not be confused with the antithesis ego-subject—external
world-object. The relation of the ego to the external world is passive in so far as it receives
stimuli from it and active when it reacts to these. It is forced by its instincts into a quite
special degree of activity towards the external world, so that we might bring out the essential
point if we say that the ego-subject is passive in respect of external stimuli but active through
its own instincts. The antithesis active—passive coalesces later with the antithesis
masculine—feminine, which, until this has taken place, has no psychological meaning. The
coupling of activity with masculinity and of passivity with femininity meets us, indeed, as a
biological fact; but it is by no means so invariably complete and exclusive as we are inclined
to assume.1

The three polarities of the mind are connected with one another in various highly
significant ways. There is a primal psychical situation in which two of them coincide.
Originally, at the very beginning of mental life, the ego is cathected with instincts and is to
some extent capable of satisfying them on itself. We call this condition ‘narcissism’ and this
way of obtaining satisfaction ‘auto-erotic’.2 At this time the external world

which the present paper was written) to the third of Freud's Three Essays (1905d),Standard
Ed., 7, 219 f.—See also p. 55 above.]

2 Some of the sexual instincts are, as we know, capable of this auto-erotic satisfaction, and so
are adapted to being the vehicle for the development under the dominance of
the pleasureprinciple [from the original ‘reality-ego’ into the ‘pleasure-ego’] which we are
about to describe [in the next paragraphs of the text]. Those sexual instincts which from the
outset require an object, and the needs of the ego-instincts, which are never capable of auto-
erotic satisfaction, naturally disturb this state [of primal narcissism] and so pave the way for
an advance from it. Indeed, the primal narcissistic state would not be able to follow
the development [that is to be described] if it were not for the fact that every individual passes
through a period during which he is helpless and has to be looked after and during which his
pressing needs are satisfied by an external agency and are thus prevented from becoming

greater.—[This very condensed footnote might have been easier to understand if it had been
placed two or three paragraphs further on. It may perhaps be expanded as follows. In his
paper on the ‘Two Principles of Mental Functioning’ (1911b) Freud had introduced
the idea of the transformation of an early ‘pleasure-ego’ into a ‘reality-ego’. In the passage
which follows in the text above, he argues that there is in fact a still earlier original ‘reality-
ego’. This original ‘reality-ego’, instead of proceeding directly into the final ‘reality-ego’, is
replaced, under the dominating influence of the pleasure principle, by a ‘pleasure-ego’. The
footnote enumerates those factors, on the one hand, which would favour this latter turn of
events, and those factors, on the other hand, which would work against it. The existence of
auto-erotic libidinal instincts would encourage the diversion to a ‘pleasure-ego’, while
the non-auto-erotic libidinal instincts and the self-preservative instincts would be likely
instead to bring about a direct transition to the final adult ‘reality-ego’. This latter result
would, he remarks, in fact come about, if it were not that parental care of the helpless infant
satisfies this second set of instincts, artificially prolongs the primary state of narcissism, and
so helps to make the establishment of the ‘pleasure-ego’ possible.]

is not cathected with interest (in a general sense) and is indifferent for purposes
of satisfaction. During this period, therefore, the ego-subject coincides with what is
pleasurable and the external world with what is indifferent (or possibly unpleasurable,
as being a source of stimulation). If for the moment we define loving as the relationof the ego
to its sources of pleasure, the situation in which the ego loves itself only and is indifferent to
the external world illustrates the first of the opposites which we found to ‘loving’.1

In so far as the ego is auto-erotic, it has no need of the external world, but, in

consequence of experiences undergone by the instincts of self-preservation, it acquires objects
from that world, and, in spite of everything, it cannot avoid feeling internal instinctual stimuli
for a time as unpleasurable. Under the

1 [On p. 133 Freud enumerates the opposites of loving in the following order: (1) hating,
(2) being loved and (3) indifference. In the present passage, and below on pp. 136 and 139, he
adopts a different order: (1) indifference, (2) hating and (3) being loved. It seems probable
that in this second arrangement he gives indifference the first place as being the first to appear
in the course of development.]

- 135 -

dominance of the pleasure principle a further development now takes place in the ego. In so
far as the objects which are presented to it are sources of pleasure, it takes them into itself,
‘introjects’ them (to use Ferenczi's [1909] term1); and, on the other hand, it expels whatever
within itself becomes a cause of unpleasure. (See below [pp.184 and 224], the mechanism
of projection.)

Thus the original ‘reality-ego’, which distinguished internal and external by means of a

sound objective criterion,2 changes into a purified ‘pleasure-ego’, which places the
characteristic of pleasure above all others. For the pleasure-ego the external world is divided
into a part that is pleasurable, which it has incorporated into itself, and a remainder that is
extraneous to it. It has separated off a part of its own self, which it projects into the external

world and feels as hostile. After this new arrangement, the two polarities coincide once more:
the ego-subject coincides with pleasure, and the external world with unpleasure (with what
was earlier indifference).

When, during the stage of primary narcissism, the object makes its appearance, the

second opposite to loving, namely hating, also attains its development.3

As we have seen, the object is brought to the ego from the external world in the first

instance by the instincts of self-preservation; and it cannot be denied that hating, too,
originally characterized the relation of the ego to the alien external world with the stimuli it
introduces. Indifference falls into place as a special case of hate or dislike, after having first
appeared as their forerunner. At the very beginning, it seems, the external world, objects, and
what is hated are identical. If later on an object turns out to be a source of pleasure, it is loved,
but it is also incorporated into the ego; so that for the purified pleasure-ego once again objects
coincide with what is extraneous and hated.

Now, however, we may note that just as the pair of opposites love—indifference reflects

the polarity ego—external world, so the second antithesis love—hate3reproduces the
polarity pleasure—unpleasure, which is linked to the first polarity. When

the purely narcissistic stage has given place to the object-stage, pleasure and unpleasure
signify relations of the ego to the object. If the object becomes a source of pleasurable
feelings, a motor urge is set up which seeks to bring the object closer to the ego and to
incorporate it into the ego. We then speak of the ‘attraction’ exercised by the pleasure-giving
object, and say that we ‘love’ that object. Conversely, if the object is a source of
unpleasurable feelings, there is an urge which endeavours to increase the distance between the
object and the ego and to repeat in relation to the object the original attempt at flight from
the external world with its emission of stimuli. We feel the ‘repulsion’ of the object,
and hate it; this hate can afterwards be intensified to the point of an aggressive inclination
against the object—an intention to destroy it.

We might at a pinch say of an instinct that it ‘loves’ the objects towards which it strives
for purposes of satisfaction; but to say that an instinct ‘hates’ an object strikes us as odd. Thus
we become aware that the attitudes1 of love and hate cannot be made use of for the relations
of instincts to their objects, but are reserved for the relations of the total ego to objects. But if
we consider linguistic usage, which is certainly not without significance, we shall see that
there is a further limitation to the meaning of love and hate. We do not say of objects which
serve the interests of self-preservation that we love them; we emphasize the fact that
we need them, and perhaps express an additional, different kind of relation to them by using
words that denote a much reduced degree of love—such as, for example, ‘being fond of’,
‘liking’ or ‘finding agreeable’.

Thus the word ‘to love’ moves further and further into the sphere of the pure pleasure-
relation of the ego to the object and finally becomes fixed to sexual objects in the narrower
sense and to those which satisfy the needs of sublimated sexual instincts. The distinction
between the ego-instincts and the sexual instincts which we have imposed upon our
psychology is thus seen to be in conformity with the spirit of our language. The fact that we
are not in the habit of saying of a single sexual instinct that it loves its object, but regard
the relation of the ego

1 [German ‘Beziehungen’, literally ‘relations’. In the first edition this word is printed

to its sexual object as the most appropriate case in which to employ the word ‘love’—this fact
teaches us that the word can only begin to be applied in this relation after there has been a
synthesis of all the component instincts of sexuality under the primacy of the genitals and in
the service of the reproductive function.

It is noteworthy that in the use of the word ‘hate’ no such intimate connection with
sexual pleasure and the sexual function appears. The relation of unpleasureseems to be the
sole decisive one. The ego hates, abhors and pursues with intent to destroy all objects which
are a source of unpleasurable feeling for it, without taking into account whether they mean
a frustration of sexual satisfaction or of the satisfaction of self-preservative needs. Indeed, it
may be asserted that the true prototypes of the relation of hate are derived not from sexual
life, but from the ego's struggle to preserve and maintain itself.

So we see that love and hate, which present themselves to us as complete opposites in
their content, do not after all stand in any simple relation to each other. They did not arise
from the cleavage of any originally common entity, but sprang from different sources, and
had each its own development before the influence of thepleasure—unpleasure relation made
them into opposites.

It now remains for us to put together what we know of the genesis

of love and hate. Love is derived from the capacity of the ego to satisfy some of its instinctual
impulses auto-erotically by obtaining organ-pleasure. It is originally narcissistic, then passes
over on to objects, which have been incorporated into the extended ego, and expresses the
motor efforts of the ego towards these objects as sources of pleasure. It becomes intimately
linked with the activity of the later sexual instincts and, when these have been completely
synthesized, coincides with the sexual impulsion as a whole. Preliminary stages
of love emerge as provisional sexual aims while the sexual instincts are passing through their
complicated development. As the first of these aims we recognize the phase of incorporating
or devouring—a type of lovewhich is consistent with abolishing the object's
separate existence and which may therefore be described as ambivalent.1 At the

organization,1 the striving for the object appears in the form of an urge for mastery, to which
injury or annihilation of the object is a matter of indifference. Love in this form and at this
preliminary stage is hardly to be distinguished from hate in its attitude towards the object. Not
until the genital organization is established does lovebecome the opposite of hate.

Hate, as a relation to objects, is older than love. It derives from the narcissistic ego's
primordial repudiation of the external world with its outpouring of stimuli. As an expression
of the reaction of unpleasure evoked by objects, it always remains in an
intimate relation with the self-preservative instincts; so that sexual and ego-instincts can
readily develop an antithesis which repeats that of love and hate. When the ego-instincts
dominate the sexual function, as is the case at the stage of the sadistic-anal organization, they
impart the qualities of hate to the instinctual aim as well.

The history of the origins and relations of love makes us understand how it is that love so

frequently manifests itself as ‘ambivalent’—i.e. as accompanied by impulses of hate against
the same object.2 The hate which is admixed with the love is in part derived from the
preliminary stages of loving which have not been wholly surmounted; it is also in part based
on reactions of repudiation by the ego-instincts, which, in view of the frequent conflicts
between the interests of the ego and those of love, can find grounds in real and contemporary
motives. In both cases, therefore, the admixed hate has as its source the self-
preservative instincts. If a love-relationwith a given object is broken off, hate not infrequently
emerges in its place, so that we get the impression of a transformation of love into hate. This
account of what happens leads on to the view that the hate, which has its real motives, is here
reinforced by a regression of the love to the sadistic preliminary stage; so that
the hateacquires an erotic character and the continuity of a love-relation is ensured.

The third antithesis of loving, the transformation of loving into being loved,3 corresponds

to the operation of the polarity

of activity and passivity, and is to be judged in the same way as the cases
of scopophilia and sadism.1

We may sum up by saying that the essential feature in the vicissitudes undergone
by instincts lies in the subjection of the instinctual impulses to the influences of the three
great polarities that dominate mental life. Of these three polarities we might describe that
of activity—passivity as the biological, that of ego—external worldas the real, and finally
that of pleasure—unpleasure as the economic polarity.

CARL JUNG

1875 - 1961

Dr. C. George Boeree

In Czech: Carl Jung (translated by Barbora Lebedová )

Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to
nothing from experimental psychology.  He would be better advised
to abandon exact science, put away his scholar's gown, bid farewell
to his study, and wander with human heart throught the world.
There in the horrors of prisons, lunatic asylums and hospitals, in
drab suburban pubs, in brothels and gambling-hells, in the salons of
the elegant, the Stock Exchanges, socialist meetings, churches,
revivalist gatherings and ecstatic sects, through love and hate,
through the experience of passion in every form in his own body, he
would reap richer stores of knowledge than text-books a foot thick
could give him, and he will know how to doctor the sick with a real
knowledge of the human soul. -- Carl Jung (from "New Paths in
Psychology", in Collected Papers on Analytic Psychology, London,
1916)

Freud said that the goal of therapy was to make the unconscious conscious. He
certainly made that the goal of his work as a theorist. And yet he makes the
unconscious sound very unpleasant, to say the least: It is a cauldron of seething
desires, a bottomless pit of perverse and incestuous cravings, a burial ground
for frightening experiences which nevertheless come back to haunt us. Frankly,
it doesn't sound like anything I'd like to make conscious!

A younger colleague of his, Carl Jung, was to make the exploration of this
"inner space" his life's work. He went equipped with a background in Freudian
theory, of course, and with an apparently inexhaustible knowledge of
mythology, religion, and philosophy. Jung was especially knowledgeable in the
symbolism of complex mystical traditions such as Gnosticism, Alchemy, Kabala,
and similar traditions in Hinduism and Buddhism. If anyone could make sense
of the unconscious and its habit of revealing itself only in symbolic form, it
would be Carl Jung.

He had, in addition, a capacity for very lucid dreaming and occasional visions.
In the fall of 1913, he had a vision of a "monstrous ﬂood" engulﬁng most of
Europe and lapping at the mountains of his native Switzerland. He saw
thousands of people drowning and civilization crumbling. Then, the waters
turned into blood. This vision was followed, in the next few weeks, by dreams
of eternal winters and rivers of blood. He was afraid that he was becoming
psychotic.

But on August 1 of that year, World War I began. Jung felt that there had been a
connection, somehow, between himself as an individual and humanity in
general that could not be explained away. From then until 1928, he was to go
through a rather painful process of self-exploration that formed the basis of all
of his later theorizing.

He carefully recorded his dreams, fantasies, and visions, and drew, painted,
and sculpted them as well. He found that his experiences tended to form
themselves into persons, beginning with a wise old man and his companion, a
little girl. The wise old man evolved, over a number of dreams, into a sort of
spiritual guru. The little girl became "anima," the feminine soul, who served as
his main medium of communication with the deeper aspects of his
unconscious.

A leathery brown dwarf would show up guarding the entrance to the
unconscious. He was "the shadow," a primitive companion for Jung's ego. Jung
dreamt that he and the dwarf killed a beautiful blond youth, whom he called
Siegfried. For Jung, this represented a warning about the dangers of the
worship of glory and heroism which would soon cause so much sorrow all over
Europe -- and a warning about the dangers of some of his own tendencies
towards hero-worship, of Sigmund Freud!

Jung dreamt a great deal about the dead, the land of the dead, and the rising of
the dead. These represented the unconscious itself -- not the "little" personal
unconscious that Freud made such a big deal out of, but a new collective
unconscious of humanity itself, an unconscious that could contain all the dead,
not just our personal ghosts. Jung began to see the mentally ill as people who
are haunted by these ghosts, in an age where no-one is supposed to even
believe in them. If we could only recapture our mythologies, we would
understand these ghosts, become comfortable with the dead, and heal our
mental illnesses.

Critics have suggested that Jung was, very simply, ill himself when all this
happened. But Jung felt that, if you want to understand the jungle, you can't be
content just to sail back and forth near the shore. You've got to get into it, no
matter how strange and frightening it might seem.

Biography

Carl Gustav Jung was born July 26, 1875, in the small Swiss village of Kessewil.
His father was Paul Jung, a country parson, and his mother was Emilie
Preiswerk Jung. He was surrounded by a fairly well educated extended family,
including quite a few clergymen and some eccentrics as well.

The elder Jung started Carl on Latin when he was six years old, beginning a
long interest in language and literature -- especially ancient literature. Besides
most modern western European languages, Jung could read
several ancient ones, including Sanskrit, the language of the
original Hindu holy books.

Carl was a rather solitary adolescent, who didn't care much
for school, and especially couldn't take competition. He went
to boarding school in Basel, Switzerland, where he found
himself the object of a lot of jealous harassment. He began to
use sickness as an excuse, developing an embarrassing tendency to faint under
pressure.

Although his ﬁrst career choice was archeology, he went on to study medicine
at the University of Basel. While working under the famous neurologist Krafft-
Ebing, he settled on psychiatry as his career.

After graduating, he took a position at the Burghoeltzli Mental Hospital in
Zurich under Eugene Bleuler, an expert on (and the namer of) schizophrenia.
In 1903, he married Emma Rauschenbach. He also taught classes at the
University of Zurich, had a private practice, and invented word association at
this time!

Long an admirer of Freud, he met him in Vienna in 1907. The story goes that
after they met, Freud canceled all his appointments for the day, and they talked
for 13 hours straight, such was the impact of the meeting of these two great
minds! Freud eventually came to see Jung as the crown prince of
psychoanalysis and his heir apparent.

But Jung had never been entirely sold on Freud's theory. Their relationship
began to cool in 1909, during a trip to America. They were entertaining
themselves by analyzing each others' dreams (more fun, apparently, than
shuﬄeboard), when Freud seemed to show an excess of resistance to Jung's
efforts at analysis. Freud ﬁnally said that they'd have to stop because he was
afraid he would lose his authority! Jung felt rather insulted.

World War I was a painful period of self-examination for Jung. It was, however,
also the beginning of one of the most interesting theories of personality the
world has ever seen.

After the war, Jung traveled widely, visiting, for example, tribal people in
Africa, America, and India. He retired in 1946, and began to retreat from public
attention after his wife died in 1955. He died on June 6, 1961, in Zurich.

Theory

Jung's theory divides the psyche into three parts. The ﬁrst is the ego,which Jung
identiﬁes with the conscious mind. Closely related is the personal
unconscious, which includes anything which is not presently conscious, but
can be. The personal unconscious is like most people's understanding of the
unconscious in that it includes both memories that are easily brought to mind
and those that have been suppressed for some reason. But it does not include
the instincts that Freud would have it include.

But then Jung adds the part of the psyche that makes his theory stand out from
all others: the collective unconscious. You could call it your "psychic
inheritance." It is the reservoir of our experiences as a species, a kind of

knowledge we are all born with. And yet we can never be directly conscious of
it. It inﬂuences all of our experiences and behaviors, most especially the
emotional ones, but we only know about it indirectly, by looking at those
inﬂuences.

There are some experiences that show the effects of the collective unconscious
more clearly than others: The experiences of love at ﬁrst sight, of deja vu (the
feeling that you've been here before), and the immediate recognition of certain
symbols and the meanings of certain myths, could all be understood as the
sudden conjunction of our outer reality and the inner reality of the collective
unconscious. Grander examples are the creative experiences shared by artists
and musicians all over the world and in all times, or the spiritual experiences
of mystics of all religions, or the parallels in dreams, fantasies, mythologies,
fairy tales, and literature.

A nice example that has been greatly discussed recently is the near-death
experience. It seems that many people, of many different cultural backgrounds,
ﬁnd that they have very similar recollections when they are brought back from
a close encounter with death. They speak of leaving their bodies, seeing their
bodies and the events surrounding them clearly, of being pulled through a long
tunnel towards a bright light, of seeing deceased relatives or religious ﬁgures
waiting for them, and of their disappointment at having to leave this happy
scene to return to their bodies. Perhaps we are all "built" to experience death in
this fashion.

Archetypes

The contents of the collective unconscious are called archetypes. Jung also
called them dominants, imagos, mythological or primordial images, and a few
other names, but archetypes seems to have won out over these. An archetype is
an unlearned tendency to experience things in a certain way.

The archetype has no form of its own, but it acts as an "organizing principle" on
the things we see or do. It works the way that instincts work in Freud's theory:
At ﬁrst, the baby just wants something to eat, without knowing what it wants. It
has a rather indeﬁnite yearning which, nevertheless, can be satisﬁed by some
things and not by others. Later, with experience, the child begins to yearn for
something more speciﬁc when it is hungry -- a bottle, a cookie, a broiled
lobster, a slice of New York style pizza.

The archetype is like a black hole in space: You only know its there by how it
draws matter and light to itself.

The mother archetype

The mother archetype is a particularly good
example. All of our ancestors had mothers. We
have evolved in an environment that included a
mother or mother-substitute. We would never
have survived without our connection with a
nurturing-one during our times as helpless
infants. It stands to reason that we are "built" in a
way that reﬂects that evolutionary environment:
We come into this world ready to want mother, to
seek her, to recognize her, to deal with her.

So the mother archetype is our built-in ability to
recognize a certain relationship, that of
"mothering." Jung says that this is rather abstract,
and we are likely to project the archetype out into

the world and onto a particular person, usually our own mothers. Even when
an archetype doesn't have a particular real person available, we tend to
personify the archetype, that is, turn it into a mythological "story-book"
character. This character symbolizes the archetype.

The mother archetype is symbolized by the primordial mother or "earth
mother" of mythology, by Eve and Mary in western traditions, and by less
personal symbols such as the church, the nation, a forest, or the ocean.
According to Jung, someone whose own mother failed to satisfy the demands of
the archetype may well be one that spends his or her life seeking comfort in the
church, or in identiﬁcation with "the motherland," or in meditating upon the
ﬁgure of Mary, or in a life at sea.

Mana

You must understand that these archetypes are not really biological things, like
Freud's instincts. They are more spiritual demands. For example, if you dreamt
about long things, Freud might suggest these things represent the phallus and
ultimately sex. But Jung might have a very different interpretation. Even

dreaming quite speciﬁcally about a penis might not have much to do with some
unfulﬁlled need for sex.

It is curious that in primitive societies, phallic symbols do not usually refer to
sex at all. They usually symbolize mana, or spiritual power. These symbols
would be displayed on occasions when the spirits are being called upon to
increase the yield of corn, or ﬁsh, or to heal someone. The connection between
the penis and strength, between semen and seed, between fertilization and
fertility are understood by most cultures.

The shadow

Sex and the life instincts in general are, of course, represented somewhere in
Jung's system. They are a part of an archetype called the shadow. It derives
from our prehuman, animal past, when our concerns were limited to survival
and reproduction, and when we weren't self-conscious.

It is the "dark side" of the ego, and the evil that we are capable of is often stored
there. Actually, the shadow is amoral -- neither good nor bad, just like animals.
An animal is capable of tender care for its young and vicious killing for food,
but it doesn't choose to do either. It just does what it does. It is "innocent." But
from our human perspective, the animal world looks rather brutal, inhuman,
so the shadow becomes something of a garbage can for the parts of ourselves
that we can't quite admit to.

Symbols of the shadow include the snake (as in the garden of Eden), the
dragon, monsters, and demons. It often guards the entrance to a cave or a pool
of water, which is the collective unconscious. Next time you dream about
wrestling with the devil, it may only be yourself you are wrestling with!

The persona

The persona represents your public image. The word is, obviously, related to
the word person and personality, and comes from a Latin word for mask. So
the persona is the mask you put on before you show yourself to the outside
world. Although it begins as an archetype, by the time we are ﬁnished realizing
it, it is the part of us most distant from the collective unconscious.

At its best, it is just the "good impression" we all wish to present as we ﬁll the
roles society requires of us. But, of course, it can also be the "false impression"
we use to manipulate people's opinions and behaviors. And, at its worst, it can

be mistaken, even by ourselves, for our
true nature: Sometimes we believe we
really are what we pretend to be!

Anima and animus

A part of our persona is the role of male or
female we must play. For most people that
role is determined by their physical
gender. But Jung, like Freud and Adler and
others, felt that we are all really bisexual in
nature. When we begin our lives as fetuses,
we have undifferentiated sex organs that
only gradually, under the inﬂuence of
hormones, become male or female.

Likewise, when we begin our social lives as infants, we are neither male nor
female in the social sense. Almost immediately -- as soon as those pink or blue
booties go on -- we come under the inﬂuence of society, which gradually molds
us into men and women.

In all societies, the expectations placed on men and women differ, usually
based on our different roles in reproduction, but often involving many details
that are purely traditional. In our society today, we still have many remnants of
these traditional expectations. Women are still expected to be more nurturant
and less aggressive; men are still expected to be strong and to ignore the
emotional side of life. But Jung felt these expectations meant that we had
developed only half of our potential.

The anima is the female aspect present in the collective unconscious of men,
and the animus is the male aspect present in the collective unconscious of
women. Together, they are refered to as syzygy. The anima may be personiﬁed
as a young girl, very spontaneous and intuitive, or as a witch, or as the earth
mother. It is likely to be associated with deep emotionality and the force of life
itself. The animus may be personiﬁed as a wise old man, a sorcerer, or often a
number of males, and tends to be logical, often rationalistic, even
argumentative.

The anima or animus is the archetype through which you communicate with
the collective unconscious generally, and it is important to get into touch with
it. It is also the archetype that is responsible for much of our love life: We are,

as an ancient Greek myth suggests, always looking for our other half, the half
that the Gods took from us, in members of the opposite sex. When we fall in
love at ﬁrst sight, then we have found someone that "ﬁlls" our anima or animus
archetype particularly well!

Other archetypes

Jung said that there is no ﬁxed number of archetypes which we could simply
list and memorize. They overlap and easily melt into each other as needed, and
their logic is not the usual kind. But here are some he mentions:

Besides mother, their are other family archetypes. Obviously, there is father,
who is often symbolized by a guide or an authority ﬁgure. There is also the
archetype family, which represents the idea of blood relationship and ties that
run deeper than those based on conscious reasons.

There is also the child, represented in mythology and art by children, infants
most especially, as well as other small creatures. The Christ child celebrated at
Christmas is a manifestation of the child archetype, and represents the future,
becoming, rebirth, and salvation. Curiously, Christmas falls during the winter
solstice, which in northern primitive cultures also represents the future and
rebirth. People used to light bonﬁres and perform ceremonies to encourage the
sun's return to them. The child archetype often blends with other archetypes to
form the child-god, or the child-hero.

Many archetypes are story characters. The hero is one of the main ones. He is
the mana personality and the defeater of evil dragons. Basically, he represents
the ego -- we do tend to identify with the hero of the story -- and is often
engaged in ﬁghting the shadow, in the form of dragons and other monsters. The
hero is, however, often dumb as a post. He is, after all, ignorant of the ways of
the collective unconscious. Luke Skywalker, in the Star Wars ﬁlms, is the
perfect example of a hero.

The hero is often out to rescue the maiden. She represents purity, innocence,
and, in all likelihood, naivete. In the beginning of the Star Wars story, Princess
Leia is the maiden. But, as the story progresses, she becomes the anima,
discovering the powers of the force -- the collective unconscious -- and
becoming an equal partner with Luke, who turns out to be her brother.

The hero is guided by the wise old man. He is a form of the animus, and
reveals to the hero the nature of the collective unconscious. In Star Wars, he is

played by Obi Wan Kenobi and, later, Yoda. Notice that they teach Luke about
the force and, as Luke matures, they die and become a part of him.

You might be curious as to the archetype represented by Darth Vader, the "dark
father." He is the shadow and the master of the dark side of the force. He also
turns out to be Luke and Leia's father. When he dies, he becomes one of the
wise old men.

There is also an animal archetype, representing humanity's relationships with
the animal world. The hero's faithful horse would be an example. Snakes are
often symbolic of the animal archetype, and are thought to be particularly
wise. Animals, after all, are more in touch with their natures than we are.
Perhaps loyal little robots and reliable old spaceships -- the Falcon-- are also
symbols of animal.

And there is the trickster, often represented by a clown or a magician. The
trickster's role is to hamper the hero's progress and to generally make trouble.
In Norse mythology, many of the gods' adventures originate in some trick or
another played on their majesties by the half-god Loki.

There are other archetypes that are a little more diﬃcult to talk about. One is
the original man, represented in western religion by Adam. Another is the God
archetype, representing our need to comprehend the universe, to give a
meaning to all that happens, to see it all as having some purpose and direction.

The hermaphrodite, both male and female, represents the union of opposites,
an important idea in Jung's theory. In some religious art, Jesus is presented as a
rather feminine man. Likewise, in China, the character Kuan Yin began as a
male saint (the bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara), but was portrayed in such a
feminine manner that he is more often thought of as the female goddess of
compassion!

The most important archetype of all is the self. The self is the ultimate unity of
the personality and issymbolized by the circle, the cross, and the mandala
ﬁgures that Jung was fond of painting. A mandala is a drawing that is used in
meditation because it tends to draw your focus back to the center, and it can be
as simple as a geometric ﬁgure or as complicated as a stained glass window.
The personiﬁcations that best represent self are Christ and Buddha, two people
who many believe achieved perfection. But Jung felt that perfection of the
personality is only truly achieved in death.

The dynamics of the psyche

So much for the content of the psyche. Now let's
turn to the principles of its operation. Jung gives us
three principles, beginning with the principle of
opposites. Every wish immediately suggests its
opposite. If I have a good thought, for example, I
cannot help but have in me somewhere the
opposite bad thought. In fact, it is a very basic
point: In order to have a concept of good, you must
have a concept of bad, just like you can't have up
without down or black without white.

This idea came home to me when I was about eleven. I occasionally tried to
help poor innocent woodland creatures who had been hurt in some way --
often, I'm afraid, killing them in the process. Once I tried to nurse a baby robin
back to health. But when I picked it up, I was so struck by how light it was that
the thought came to me that I could easily crush it in my hand. Mind you, I
didn't like the idea, but it was undeniably there.

According to Jung, it is the opposition that creates the power (or libido) of the
psyche. It is like the two poles of a battery, or the splitting of an atom. It is the
contrast that gives energy, so that a strong contrast gives strong energy, and a
weak contrast gives weak energy.

The second principle is the principle of equivalence. The energy created from
the opposition is "given" to both sides equally. So, when I held that baby bird in
my hand, there was energy to go ahead and try to help it. But there is an equal
amount of energy to go ahead and crush it. I tried to help the bird, so that
energy went into the various behaviors involved in helping it. But what
happens to the other energy?

Well, that depends on your attitude towards the wish that you didn't fulﬁll. If
you acknowledge it, face it, keep it available to the conscious mind, then the
energy goes towards a general improvement of your psyche. You grow, in other
words.

But if you pretend that you never had that evil wish, if you deny and suppress
it, the energy will go towards the development of a complex. A complex is a
pattern of suppressed thoughts and feelings that cluster -- constellate -- around

a theme provided by some archetype. If you deny ever having thought about
crushing the little bird, you might put that idea into the form offered by the
shadow (your "dark side"). Or if a man denies his emotional side, his
emotionality might ﬁnd its way into the anima archetype. And so on.

Here's where the problem comes: If you pretend all your life that you are only
good, that you don't even have the capacity to lie and cheat and steal and kill,
then all the times when you do good, that other side of you goes into a complex
around the shadow. That complex will begin to develop a life of its own, and it
will haunt you. You might ﬁnd yourself having nightmares in which you go
around stomping on little baby birds!

If it goes on long enough, the complex may take over, may "possess" you, and
you might wind up with a multiple personality. In the movie The Three Faces of
Eve, Joanne Woodward portrayed a meek, mild woman who eventually
discovered that she went out and partied like crazy on Saturday nights. She
didn't smoke, but found cigarettes in her purse, didn't drink, but woke up with
hangovers, didn't fool around, but found herself in sexy outﬁts. Although
multiple personality is rare, it does tend to involve these kinds of black-and-
white extremes.

The ﬁnal principle is the principle of entropy. This is the tendency for
oppositions to come together, and so for energy to decrease, over a person's
lifetime. Jung borrowed the idea from physics, where entropy refers to the
tendency of all physical systems to "run down," that is, for all energy to become
evenly distributed. If you have, for example, a heat source in one corner of the
room, the whole room will eventually be heated.

When we are young, the opposites will tend to be extreme, and so we tend to
have lots of energy. For example, adolescents tend to exaggerate male-female
differences, with boys trying hard to be macho and girls trying equally hard to
be feminine. And so their sexual activity is invested with great amounts of
energy! Plus, adolescents often swing from one extreme to another, being wild
and crazy one minute and ﬁnding religion the next.

As we get older, most of us come to be more comfortable with our different
facets. We are a bit less naively idealistic and recognize that we are all mixtures
of good and bad. We are less threatened by the opposite sex within us and
become more androgynous. Even physically, in old age, men and women

become more alike. This process of rising above our opposites, of seeing both
sides of who we are, is called transcendence.

The self

The goal of life is to realize the self. The self is an archetype that represents the
transcendence of all opposites, so that every aspect of your personality is
expressed equally. You are then neither and both male and female, neither and
both ego and shadow, neither and both good and bad, neither and both
conscious and unconscious, neither and both an individual and the whole of
creation. And yet, with no oppositions, there is no energy, and you cease to act.
Of course, you no longer need to act.

To keep it from getting too mystical, think of it as a new center, a more
balanced position, for your psyche. When you are young, you focus on the ego
and worry about the trivialities of the persona. When you are older (assuming
you have been developing as you should), you focus a little deeper, on the self,
and become closer to all people, all life, even the universe itself. The self-
realized person is actually less selﬁsh.

Synchronicity

Personality theorists have argued for many years about whether psychological
processes function in terms of mechanism or teleology. Mechanism is the idea
that things work in through cause and effect: One thing leads to another which
leads to another, and so on, so that the past determines the present. Teleology is
the idea that we are lead on by our ideas about a future state, by things like
purposes, meanings, values, and so on. Mechanism is linked with determinism
and with the natural sciences. Teleology is linked with free will and has become
rather rare. It is still common among moral, legal, and religious philosophers,
and, of course, among personality theorists.

Among the people discussed in this book, Freudians and behaviorists tend to be
mechanists, while the neo-Freudians, humanists, and existentialists tend to be
teleologists. Jung believes that both play a part. But he adds a third alternative
called synchronicity.

Synchronicity is the occurrence of two events that are not linked causally, nor
linked teleologically, yet are meaningfully related. Once, a client was describing
a dream involving a scarab beetle when, at that very instant, a very similar
beetle ﬂew into the window. Often, people dream about something, like the

death of a loved one, and ﬁnd the next morning that their loved one did, in fact,
die at about that time. Sometimes people pick up he phone to call a friend, only
to ﬁnd that their friend is already on the line. Most psychologists would call
these things coincidences, or try to show how they are more likely to occur
than we think. Jung believed the were indications of how we are connected,
with our fellow humans and with nature in general, through the collective
unconscious.

Jung was never clear about his own religious beliefs. But this unusual idea of
synchronicity is easily explained by the Hindu view of reality. In the Hindu
view, our individual egos are like islands in a sea: We look out at the world and
each other and think we are separate entities. What we don't see is that we are
connected to each other by means of the ocean ﬂoor beneath the waters.

The outer world is called maya, meaning illusion, and is thought of as God's
dream or God's dance. That is, God creates it, but it has no reality of its own.
Our individual egos they call jivatman, which means individual souls. But they,
too, are something of an illusion. We are all actually extensions of the one and
only Atman, or God, who allows bits of himself to forget his identity, to become
apparently separate and independent, to become us. But we never truly are
separate. When we die, we wake up and realize who we were from the
beginning: God.

When we dream or meditate, we sink into our personal unconscious, coming
closer and closer to our true selves, the collective unconscious. It is in states like
this that we are especially open to "communications" from other egos.
Synchronicity makes Jung's theory one of the rare ones that is not only
compatible with parapsychological phenomena, but actually tries to explain
them!

Introversion and extroversion

Jung developed a personality typology that has become so popular that some
people don't realize he did anything else! It begins with the distinction between
introversion and extroversion. Introverts are people who prefer their
internal world of thoughts, feelings, fantasies, dreams, and so on, while
extroverts prefer the external world of things and people and activities.

The words have become confused with ideas like shyness and sociability,
partially because introverts tend to be shy and extroverts tend to be sociable.
But Jung intended for them to refer more to whether you ("ego") more often
faced toward the persona and outer reality, or toward the collective
unconscious and its archetypes. In that sense, the introvert is somewhat more
mature than the extrovert. Our culture, of course, values the extrovert much
more. And Jung warned that we all tend to value our own type most!

We now ﬁnd the introvert-extravert dimension in several theories, notably
Hans Eysenck's, although often hidden under alternative names such as
"sociability" and "surgency."

The functions

Whether we are introverts or extroverts, we need to deal with the world, inner
and outer. And each of us has our preferred ways of dealing with it, ways we
are comfortable with and good at. Jung suggests there are four basic ways, or
functions:

The ﬁrst is sensing. Sensing means what it says: getting information by means
of the senses. A sensing person is good at looking and listening and generally
getting to know the world. Jung called this one of the irrational functions,
meaning that it involved perception rather than judging of information.

The second is thinking. Thinking means evaluating information or ideas
rationally, logically. Jung called this a rational function, meaning that it
involves decision making or judging, rather than simple intake of information.

The third is intuiting. Intuiting is a kind of perception that works outside of the
usual conscious processes. It is irrational or perceptual, like sensing, but comes
from the complex integration of large amounts of information, rather than
simple seeing or hearing. Jung said it was like seeing around corners.

The fourth is feeling. Feeling, like thinking, is a matter of evaluating
information, this time by weighing one's overall, emotional response. Jung calls
it rational, obviously not in the usual sense of the word.

We all have these functions. We just have them in different proportions, you
might say. Each of us has a superior function, which we prefer and which is
best developed in us, a secondary function, which we are aware of and use in
support of our superior function, a tertiary function, which is only slightly less
developed but not terribly conscious, and an inferior function, which is poorly
developed and so unconscious that we might deny its existence in ourselves.

Most of us develop only one or two of the functions, but our goal should be to
develop all four. Once again, Jung sees the transcendence of opposites as the
ideal.

Assessment

Katharine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers found Jung's types and
functions so revealing of people's personalities that they decided to develop a
paper-and-pencil test. It came to be called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,
and is one of the most popular, and most studied, tests around.

On the basis of your answers on about 125 questions, you are placed in one of
sixteen types, with the understanding that some people might ﬁnd themselves
somewhere between two or three types. What type you are says quite a bit
about you -- your likes and dislikes, your likely career choices, your
compatibility with others, and so on. People tend to like it quite a bit. It has the
unusual quality among personality tests of not being too judgmental: None of
the types is terribly negative, nor are any overly positive. Rather than assessing

how "crazy" you are, the "Myers-Briggs" simply opens up your personality for
exploration.

The test has four scales. Extroversion - Introversion (E-I) is the most
important. Test researchers have found that about 75 % of the population is
extroverted.

The next one is Sensing - Intuiting (S-N), with about 75 % of the population
sensing.

The next is Thinking - Feeling (T-F). Although these are distributed evenly
through the population, researchers have found that two-thirds of men are
thinkers, while two-thirds of women are feelers. This might seem like
stereotyping, but keep in mind that feeling and thinking are both valued
equally by Jungians, and that one-third of men are feelers and one-third of
women are thinkers. Note, though, that society does value thinking and feeling
differently, and that feeling men and thinking women often have diﬃculties
dealing with people's stereotyped expectations.

The last is Judging - Perceiving (J-P), not one of Jung's original dimensions.
Myers and Briggs included this one in order to help determine which of a
person's functions is superior. Generally, judging people are more careful,
perhaps inhibited, in their lives. Perceiving people tend to be more
spontaneous, sometimes careless. If you are an extrovert and a "J," you are a
thinker or feeler, whichever is stronger. Extroverted and "P" means you are a
senser or intuiter. On the other hand, an introvert with a high "J" score will be
a senser or intuiter, while an introvert with a high "P" score will be a thinker or
feeler. J and P are equally distributed in the population.

Each type is identiﬁed by four letters, such as ENFJ. These have proven so
popular, you can even ﬁnd them on people's license plates!

ENFJ (Extroverted feeling with intuiting): These people are easy speakers. They
tend to idealize their friends. They make good parents, but have a tendency to
allow themselves to be used. They make good therapists, teachers, executives,
and salespeople.

ENFP (Extroverted intuiting with feeling): These people love novelty and
surprises. They are big on emotions and expression. They are susceptible to
muscle tension and tend to be hyperalert. they tend to feel self-conscious. They
are good at sales, advertising, politics, and acting.

ENTJ (Extroverted thinking with intuiting): In charge at home, they expect a lot
from spouses and kids. They like organization and structure and tend to make
good executives and administrators.

ENTP (Extroverted intuiting with thinking): These are lively people, not
humdrum or orderly. As mates, they are a little dangerous, especially
economically. They are good at analysis and make good entrepreneurs. They do
tend to play at oneupmanship.

ESFJ (Extroverted feeling with sensing): These people like harmony. They tend
to have strong shoulds and should-nots. They may be dependent, ﬁrst on
parents and later on spouses. They wear their hearts on their sleeves and excel
in service occupations involving personal contact.

ESFP (Extroverted sensing with feeling): Very generous and impulsive, they
have a low tolerance for anxiety. They make good performers, they like public
relations, and they love the phone. They should avoid scholarly pursuits,
especially science.

ESTJ (Extroverted thinking with sensing): These are responsible mates and
parents and are loyal to the workplace. They are realistic, down-to-earth,
orderly, and love tradition. They often ﬁnd themselves joining civic clubs!

ESTP (Extroverted sensing with thinking): These are action-oriented people,
often sophisticated, sometimes ruthless -- our "James Bonds." As mates, they are
exciting and charming, but they have trouble with commitment. They make
good promoters, entrepreneurs, and con artists.

INFJ (Introverted intuiting with feeling): These are serious students and
workers who really want to contribute. They are private and easily hurt. They
make good spouses, but tend to be physically reserved. People often think they
are psychic. They make good therapists, general practitioners, ministers, and so
on.

INFP (Introverted feeling with intuiting): These people are idealistic, self-
sacriﬁcing, and somewhat cool or reserved. They are very family and home
oriented, but don't relax well. You ﬁnd them in psychology, architecture, and
religion, but never in business.

INTJ (Introverted intuiting with thinking): These are the most independent of
all types. They love logic and ideas and are drawn to scientiﬁc research. They

can be rather single-minded, though.

INTP (Introverted thinking with intuiting): Faithful, preoccupied, and forgetful,
these are the bookworms. They tend to be very precise in their use of language.
They are good at logic and math and make good philosophers and theoretical
scientists, but not writers or salespeople.

ISFJ (Introverted sensing with feeling): These people are service and work
oriented. They may suffer from fatigue and tend to be attracted to
troublemakers. They are good nurses, teachers, secretaries, general
practitioners, librarians, middle managers, and housekeepers.

ISFP (Introverted feeling with sensing): They are shy and retiring, are not
talkative, but like sensuous action. They like painting, drawing, sculpting,
composing, dancing -- the arts generally -- and they like nature. They are not
big on commitment.

ISTJ (Introverted sensing with thinking): These are dependable pillars of
strength. They often try to reform their mates and other people. They make
good bank examiners, auditors, accountants, tax examiners, supervisors in
libraries and hospitals, business, home ec., and phys. ed. teachers, and boy or
girl scouts!

ISTP (Introverted thinking with sensing): These people are action-oriented and
fearless, and crave excitement. They are impulsive and dangerous to stop. They
often like tools, instruments, and weapons, and often become technical experts.
They are not interested in communications and are often incorrectly diagnosed
as dyslexic or hyperactive. They tend to do badly in school.

Even without taking the test, you may very well recognize yourself in one or
two of these types. Or ask others -- they may be more accurate!   But, if you like,
you can take my Jungian personality test on the internet:  Just click here!

Discussion

Quite a few people ﬁnd that Jung has a great deal to say to them. They include
writers, artists, musicians, ﬁlm makers, theologians, clergy of all
denominations, students of mythology, and, of course, some psychologists.
Examples that come to mind are the mythologist Joseph Campbell, the ﬁlm
maker George Lucas, and the science ﬁction author Ursula K. Le Guin. Anyone

interested in creativity, spirituality, psychic phenomena, the universal, and so
on will ﬁnd in Jung a kindred spirit.

But scientists, including most psychologists, have a lot of trouble with Jung. Not
only does he fully support the teleological view (as do most personality
theorists), but he goes a step further and talks about the mystical
interconnectedness of synchronicity. Not only does he postulate an
unconscious, where things are not easily available to the empirical eye, but he
postulates a collective unconscious that never has been and never will be
conscious.

In fact, Jung takes an approach that is essentially the reverse of the
mainstream's reductionism: Jung begins with the highest levels -- even
spiritualism -- and derives the lower levels of psychology and physiology from
them.

Even psychologists who applaud his teleology and antireductionist position
may not be comfortable with him. Like Freud, Jung tries to bring everything
into his system. He has little room for chance, accident, or circumstances.
Personality -- and life in general -- seems "over-explained" in Jung's theory.

I have found that his theory sometimes attracts students who have diﬃculty
dealing with reality. When the world, especially the social world, becomes too
diﬃcult, some people retreat into fantasy. Some, for example, become couch
potatoes. But others turn to complex ideologies that pretend to explain
everything. Some get involved in Gnostic or Tantric religions, the kind that
present intricate rosters of angels and demons and heavens and hells, and
endlessly discuss symbols. Some go to Jung. There is nothing intrinsically
wrong with this; but for someone who is out of touch with reality, this is hardly
going to help.

These criticisms do not cut the foundation out from under Jung's theory. But
they do suggest that some careful consideration is in order.

The positive things

On the plus side, there is the Myers-Briggs and other tests based on Jung's types
and functions. Because they do not place people on dimensions that run from
"good" to "bad," they are much less threatening. They encourage people to
become more aware of themselves.

The archetypes, at ﬁrst glance, might seem to be Jung's strangest idea. And yet
they have proven to be very useful in the analysis of myths, fairy tales,
literature in general, artistic symbolism, and religious exposition. They
apparently capture some of the basic "units" of our self-expression. Many
people have suggested that there are only so many stories and characters in the
world, and we just keep on rearranging the details.

This suggests that the archetypes actually do refer to some deep structures of
the human mind. After all, from the physiological perspective, we come into his
world with a certain structure: We see in a certain way, hear in a certain way,
"process information" in a certain way, behave in a certain way, because our
neurons and glands and muscles are structured in a certain way. At least one
cognitive psychologist has suggested looking for the structures that correspond
to Jung's archetypes!

Finally, Jung has opened our eyes to the differences between child development
and adult development. Children clearly emphasize differentiation --
separating one thing from another -- in their learning. "What's this?" " Why is it
this way and not that?" "What kinds are there?" They actively seek diversity.
And many people, psychologists included, have been so impressed by this that
they have assumed that all learning is a matter of differentiation, of learning
more and more "things."

But Jung has pointed out that adults search more for integration, for the
transcending of opposites. Adults search for the connections between things,
how things ﬁt together, how they interact, how they contribute to the whole.
We want to make sense of it, ﬁnd the meaning of it, the purpose of it all.
Children unravel the world; adults try to knit it back together.

Connections

On the one hand, Jung is still attached to his Freudian roots. He emphasizes the
unconscious even more than Freudians do. In fact, he might be seen as the
logical extension of Freud's tendency to put the causes of things into the past.
Freud, too, talked about myths --Oedipus, for example -- and how they impact
on the modern psyche.

On the other hand, Jung has a lot in common with the neo-Freudians,
humanists, and existentialists. He believes that we are meant to progress, to
move in a positive direction, and not just to adapt, as the Freudians and

behaviorists would have it. His idea of self-realization is clearly similar to self-
actualization.

The balancing or transcending of opposites also has counterparts in other
theories. Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, Andreas Angyal, David Bakan, Gardner
Murphy, and Rollo May all make reference to balancing two opposing
tendencies, one towards individual development and the other towards the
development of compassion or social interest. Rollo May talks about the psyche
being composed of many "daimons" (little gods) such as the desire for sex, or
love, or power. All are positive in their place, but should any one take over the
whole personality, we would have "daimonic possession," or mental illness!

Finally, we owe to Jung the broadening of interpretation, whether of symptoms
or dreams or free-associations. While Freud developed more-or-less rigid
(speciﬁcally, sexual) interpretations, Jung allowed for a rather free-wheeling
"mythological" interpretation, wherein anything could mean, well, anything.
Existential analysis, in particular, has beneﬁted from Jung's ideas.

Readings

Most of Jung's writings are contained in The Collected Works of Carl G. Jung.
I have to warn you that most of his works are not easy going, but they are full
of interesting things that make them worth the trouble.

If you are looking for something a little easier, you might try Analytic
Psychology: Its Theory and Practice, which is a collection of lectures and is
available in paperback. Or read Man and His Symbols, which is available in
several editions ranging from large ones with many color pictures to an
inexpensive paperback. If you want a smattering of Jung, try a collection of his
writings, such as Modern Library's The Basic Writings of C. C. Jung.

The best book I've ever read about Jung, however, is the autobiographical
Memories, Dreams, Reﬂections, written with his student Aniela Jaffï¿½. It
makes a good introduction, assuming you've read something like the preceding
chapter ﬁrst.

CARL JUNG

The Concept of the Collective Unconscious

Carl G. Jung (1875-1961) was a Swiss psychologist whose principles have been found
to be applicable to nearly all academic disciplines from mythology to religion to
quantum physics, and to nearly all aspects of modern life. In the following selection,
Jung discusses his most well-known (and controversial) concept, the collective uncon-
scious, that aspect of the unconscious mind which manifests inherited, universal themes
which run through all human life. The contents of the collective unconscious are
archetypes, primordial images that reflect basic patterns or common to us all, and which
have existed universally since the dawn of time.

PROBABLY NONE OF MY empirical concepts
has met with so much misunderstanding as the
idea of  the collective unconscious. In what follows
I shall try to give (1) a definition of the concept,
(2) a description of  what it means for psychology,
(3) an explanation of the method of proof, and
(4) an example.

1. Definition

The collective unconscious is a part of the

psyche which can be negatively distinguished from
a personal unconscious by the fact that it does not,
like the latter, owe its existence to personal experi-
ence and consequently is not a personal acquisition.
While the personal unconscious is made up
essentially of contents which have at one time been
conscious but which have disappeared from
consciousness through having been forgotten or
repressed, the contents of the collective uncon-
scious have never been in consciousness, and
therefore have never been individually acquired,
but owe their existence exclusively to heredity.
Whereas the personal unconscious consists for the
most part of complexes, the content of the collective
unconscious is made up essentially of  archetypes.
The concept of the archetype, which is an
indispensable correlate of the idea of the collective
unconscious, indicates the existence of definite
forms in the psyche which seem to be present
always and everywhere. Mythological research calls
them “motifs”; in the psychology of  primitives
they correspond to Levy-Bruhl’s concept of

“representations collectives,” and in the field of
comparative religion they have been defined by
Hubert and Mauss as “categories of the imagina-
tion.” Adolf Bastian long ago called them “el-
ementary” or “primordial thoughts.” From these
references it should be clear enough that my idea
of  the archetype—literally a pre-existent form—
does not stand alone but is something that is
recognized and named in other fields of knowl-
edge.

My thesis, then, is as follows: In addition to

our immediate consciousness, which is of a
thoroughly personal nature and which we believe
to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on
the personal unconscious as an appendix), there
exists a second psychic system of a collective,
universal, and impersonal nature which is identical
in all individuals. This collective unconscious does
not develop individually but is inherited. It consists
of  pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can
only become conscious secondarily and which give
definite form to certain psychic contents.

2. The Psychological Meaning of the
Collective Unconscious

Medical psychology, growing as it did out of

professional practice, insists on the personal nature
of the psyche. By this I mean the views of Freud
and Adler. It is a psychology of  the person, and its
aetiological or causal factors are regarded almost
wholly as personal in nature. Nonetheless, even this
psychology is based on certain general biological

99

100

Understanding Dreams

factors, for instance on the sexual instinct or on the
urge for self-assertion, which are by no means
merely personal peculiarities. It is forced to do this
because it lays claim to being an explanatory
science. Neither of these views would deny the
existence of a priori instincts common to man and
animals alike, or that they have a significant influ-
ence on personal psychology. Yet instincts are
impersonal, universally distributed, hereditary
factors of a dynamic or motivating character,
which very often fail so completely to reach
consciousness that modern psychotherapy is faced
with the task of helping the patient to become
conscious of them. Moreover, the instincts are not
vague and indefinite by nature, but are specifically
formed motive forces which, long before there is
any consciousness, and in spite of any degree of
consciousness later on, pursue their inherent goals.
Consequently they form very close analogies to the
archetypes, so close, in fact, that there is good
reason for supposing that the archetypes are the
unconscious images of the instincts themselves, in
other words, that they are patterns of  instinctual
behaviour.

The hypothesis of the collective unconscious
is, therefore, no more daring than to assume there
are instincts. One admits readily that human activity
is influenced to a high degree by instincts, quite
apart from the rational motivations of the con-
scious mind. So if the assertion is made that our
imagination, perception, and thinking are likewise
influenced by in-born and universally present
formal elements, it seems to me that a normally
functioning intelligence can discover in this idea just
as much or just as little mysticism as in the theory
of  instincts. Although this reproach of  mysticism
has frequently been leveled at my concept, I must
emphasize yet again that the concept of the
collective unconscious is neither a speculative nor a
philosophical but an empirical matter. The question
is simply this: are there or are there not uncon-
scious, universal forms of  this kind? If  they exist,
then there is a region of the psyche which one can
call the collective unconscious. It is true that the
diagnosis of the collective unconscious is not
always an easy task. It is not sufficient to point out
the often obviously archetypal nature of uncon-
scious products, for these can just as well be
derived from acquisitions through language and

education. Cryptomnesia should also be ruled out,
which it is almost impossible to do in certain cases.
In spite of all these difficulties, there remain
enough individual instances showing the autoch-
thonous revival of mythological motifs to put the
matter beyond any reasonable doubt. But if such
an unconscious exists at all, psychological explana-
tion must take account of it and submit certain
alleged personal aetiologies to sharper criticism.

What I mean can perhaps best be made clear

by a concrete example. You have probably read
Freud’s discussion1 of  a certain picture by
Leonardo da Vinci: St. Anne with the Virgin Mary
and the Christ-child. Freud interprets this remark-
able picture in terms of  the fact that Leonardo
himself  had two mothers. This causality is per-
sonal. We shall not linger over the fact that this
picture is far from unique, nor over the minor
inaccuracy that St. Anne happens to be the grand-
mother of  Christ and not, as required by Freud’s
interpretation, the mother, but shall simply point
out that interwoven with the apparently personal
psychology there is an impersonal motif  well
known to us from other fields. This is the motif
of the dual mother, an archetype to be found in
many variants in the field of  mythology and
comparative religion and forming the basis of
numerous “representations collectives.” I might
mention, for instance, the motif of the dual descent,
that is, descent from human and divine parents, as
in the case of Heracles, who received immortality
through being unwittingly adopted by Hera. What
was a myth in Greece was actually a ritual in
Egypt: Pharaoh was both human and divine by
nature. In the birth chambers of  the Egyptian
temples Pharaoh’s second, divine conception and
birth is depicted on the walls; he is “twice-born.”
It is an idea that underlies all rebirth mysteries,
Christianity included. Christ himself is “twice-
born”: through his baptism in the Jordan he was
regenerated and reborn from water and spirit.
Consequently, in the Roman liturgy the font is
designated the “uterus ecclesiae,” and, as you can
read in the Roman missal, it is called this even
today, in the “benediction of  the font” on Holy
Saturday before Easter. Further, according to an
early Christian-Gnostic idea, the spirit which
appeared in the form of  a dove was interpreted as
Sophia-Sapientia—Wisdom and the Mother of

Christ. Thanks to this motif of the dual birth,
children today, instead of  having good and evil
fairies who magically “adopt” them at birth with
blessings or curses, are given sponsors—a “god-
father” and a “godmother.”

The idea of a second birth is found at all
times and in all places. In the earliest beginnings of
medicine it was a magical means of healing; in
many religions it is the central mystical experience;
it is the key idea in medieval, occult philosophy,
and, last but not least, it is an infantile fantasy
occurring in numberless children, large and small,
who believe that their parents are not their real
parents but merely foster-parents to whom they
were handed over. Benvenuto Cellini also had this
idea, as he himself  relates in his autobiography.

Now it is absolutely out of the question that

all the individuals who believe in a dual descent
have in reality always had two mothers, or con-
versely that those few who shared Leonardo’s fate
have infected the rest of humanity with their
complex. Rather, one cannot avoid the assumption
that the universal occurrence of the dual-birth
motif together with the fantasy of the two
mothers answers an omnipresent human need
which is reflected in these motifs. If  Leonardo da
Vinci did in fact portray his two mothers in St.
Anne and Mary—which I doubt—he nonetheless
was only expressing something which countless
millions of people before and after him have
believed. The vulture symbol (which Freud also
discusses in the work mentioned) makes this view
all the more plausible. With some justification he
quotes as the source of the symbol the Hieroglyphica
of  Horapollo, a book much in use in Leonardo’s
time. There you read that vultures are female only
and symbolize the mother. They conceive through
the wind (pneuma). This word took on the meaning
of “spirit” chiefly under the influence of Christian-
ity. Even in the account of  the miracle at Pentecost
the pneuma still has the double meaning of wind
and spirit. This fact, in my opinion, points without
doubt to Mary, who, a virgin by nature, conceived
through the pneuma, like a vulture. Furthermore,
according to Horapollo, the vulture also symbol-
izes Athene, who sprang, unbegotten, directly from
the head of Zeus, was a virgin, and knew only
spiritual motherhood. All this is really an allusion to
Mary and the rebirth motif. There is not a shadow

Carl Jung

101

of evidence that Leonardo meant anything else by
his picture. Even if it is correct to assume that he
identified himself with the Christ-child, he was in
all probability representing the mythological dual-
mother motif and by no means his own personal
prehistory. And what about all the other artists
who painted the same theme? Surely not all of
them had two mothers?

Let us now transpose Leonardo’s case to the

field of the neuroses, and assume that a patient
with a mother complex is suffering from the
delusion that the cause of his neurosis lies in his
having really had two mothers. The personal
interpretation would have to admit that he is
right—and yet it would be quite wrong. For in
reality the cause of his neurosis would lie in the
reactivation of the dual-mother archetype, quite
regardless of whether he had one mother or two
mothers, because, as we have seen, this archetype
functions individually and historically without any
reference to the relatively rare occurrence of dual
motherhood.

In such a case, it is of course tempting to
presuppose so simple and personal a cause, yet the
hypothesis is not only inexact but totally false. It is
admittedly difficult to understand how a dual-
mother motif—unknown to a physician trained
only in medicine—could have so great a determin-
ing power as to produce the effect of a traumatic
condition. But if we consider the tremendous
powers that lie hidden in the mythological and
religious sphere in man, the aetiological significance
of the archetype appears less fantastic. In numer-
ous cases of neurosis the cause of the disturbance
lies in the very fact that the psychic life of the
patient lacks the co-operation of these motive
forces. Nevertheless a purely personalistic psy-
chology, by reducing everything to personal causes,
tries its level best to deny the existence of arche-
typal motifs and even seeks to destroy them by
personal analysis. I consider this a rather dangerous
procedure which cannot be justified medically.
Today you can judge better than you could twenty
years ago the nature of the forces involved. Can
we not see how a whole nation is reviving an
archaic symbol, yes, even archaic religious forms,
and how this mass emotion is influencing and
revolutionizing the life of the individual in a
catastrophic manner? The man of the past is alive

Understanding Dreams

in us today to a degree undreamt of before the
war, and in the last analysis what is the fate of
great nations but a summation of the psychic
changes in individuals?

So far as a neurosis is really only a private

affair, having its roots exclusively in personal
causes, archetypes play no role at all. But if it is a
question of a general incompatibility or an other-
wise injurious condition productive of neuroses in
relatively large numbers of individuals, then we
must assume the presence of constellated arche-
types. Since neuroses are in most cases not just
private concerns, but social phenomena, we must
assume that archetypes are constellated in these
cases too. The archetype corresponding to the
situation is activated, and as a result those explosive
and dangerous forces hidden in the archetype
come into action, frequently with unpredictable
consequences. There is no lunacy people under the
domination of  an archetype will not fall a prey to.
If thirty years ago anyone had dared to predict
that our psychological development was tending
towards a revival of the medieval persecutions of
the Jews, that Europe would again tremble before
the Roman fasces and the tramp of legions, that
people would once more give the Roman salute,
as two thousand years ago, and that instead of  the
Christian Cross an archaic swastika would lure
onward  millions  of  warriors  ready  for  death—
why, that man would have been hooted at as a
mystical fool. And today? Surprising as it may
seem, all this absurdity is a horrible reality. Private
life, private aetiologies, and private neuroses have
become almost a fiction in the world of  today.
The man of the past who lived in a world of
archaic “representations collectives” has risen again
into very visible and painfully real life, and this not
only in a few unbalanced individuals but in many
millions  of  people.

There are as many archetypes as there are

typical situations in life. Endless repetition has
engraved these experiences into our psychic
constitution, not in the form of  images filled with
content, but at first only as forms without content,
representing merely the possibility of a certain type
of perception and action. When a situation occurs
which corresponds to a given archetype, that
archetype becomes activated and a compulsiveness
appears, which, like an instinctual drive, gains its

way against all reason and will, or else produces a
conflict of  pathological dimensions, that is to say, a
neurosis.

3. Method of Proof

We must now turn to the question of  how
the existence of archetypes can be proved. Since
archetypes are supposed to produce certain
psychic forms, we must discuss how and where
one can get hold of the material demonstrating
these forms. The main source, then, is dreams,
which have the advantage of  being involuntary,
spontaneous products of the unconscious psyche
and are therefore pure products of nature not
falsified by any conscious purpose. By questioning
the individual one can ascertain which of the
motifs appearing in the dream are known to him.
From those which are unknown to him we must
naturally exclude all motifs which might be known
to him, as for instance—to revert to the case of
Leonardo—the vulture symbol. We are not sure
whether Leonardo took this symbol from
Horapollo or not, although it would have been
perfectly possible for an educated person of that
time, because in those days artists were distin-
guished for their wide knowledge of the humani-
ties. Therefore, although the bird motif  is an
archetype par excellence, its existence in Leonardo’s
fantasy would still prove nothing. Consequently, we
must look for motifs which could not possibly be
known to the dreamer and yet behave functionally
in his dream in such a manner as to coincide with
the functioning of the archetype known from
historical sources.

Another source for the material we need is to
he found in “active imagination.” By this I mean a
sequence of fantasies produced by deliberate
concentration. I have found that the existence of
unrealized, unconscious fantasies increases the
frequency and intensity of dreams, and that when
these fantasies are made conscious the dreams
change their character and become weaker and less
frequent. From this I have drawn the conclusion
that dreams often contain fantasies which “want”
to become conscious. The sources of  dreams are
often repressed instincts which have a natural
tendency to influence the conscious mind. In cases
of this sort, the patient is simply given the task of
contemplating any one fragment of fantasy that

seems significant to him—a chance idea, perhaps,
or something he has become conscious of in a
dream—until its context becomes visible, that is to
say, the relevant associative material in which it is
embedded. It is not a question of the “free
association” recommended by Freud for the
purpose of dream-analysis, but of elaborating the
fantasy by observing the further fantasy material
that adds itself  to the fragment in a natural manner.
This is not the place to enter upon a technical
discussion of the method. Suffice it to say that the
resultant sequence of fantasies relieves the uncon-
scious and produces material rich in archetypal
images and associations. Obviously, this is a
method that can only be used in certain carefully
selected cases. The method is not entirely without
danger, because it may carry the patient too far
away from reality. A warning against thoughtless
application is therefore in place.

Finally, very interesting sources of  archetypal

material are to be found in the delusions of
paranoiacs, the fantasies observed in trance-states,
and the dreams of early childhood, from the third
to the fifth year. Such material is available in
profusion, but it is valueless unless one can adduce
convincing mythological parallels. It does not, of
course, suffice simply to connect a dream about a
snake with the mythological occurrence of snakes,
for who is to guarantee that the functional meaning
of the snake in the dream is the same as in the
mythological setting? In order to draw a valid
parallel, it is necessary to know the functional
meaning of the individual symbol, and then to find
out whether the apparently parallel mythological
symbol has a similar context and therefore the
same functional meaning. Establishing such facts
not only requires lengthy and wearisome re-
searches, but is also an ungrateful subject for
demonstration. As the symbols must not be torn
out of their context, one has to launch forth into
exhaustive descriptions, personal as well as
symbological, and this is practically impossible in
the framework of a lecture. I have repeatedly tried
it at the risk of sending one half of my audience
to sleep.

4. An Example

I am choosing as an example a case which,
though already published, I use again because its

Carl Jung

103

brevity makes it peculiarly suitable for illustration.
Moreover, I can add certain remarks which were
omitted in the previous publication.2

About 1906 I came across a very curious
delusion in a paranoid schizophrenic who had
been interned for many years. The patient had
suffered since his youth and was incurable. He had
been educated at a State school and been em-
ployed as a clerk in an office. He had no special
gifts, and I myself  knew nothing of  mythology or
archaeology in those days, so the situation was not
in any way suspect. One day I found the patient
standing at the window, wagging his head and
blinking into the sun. He told me to do the same,
for then I would see something very interesting.
When I asked him what he saw, he was astonished
that I could see nothing, and said: “Surely you see
the sun’s penis—when I move my head to and fro,
it moves too, and that is where the wind comes
from.” Naturally I did not under-stand this strange
idea in the least, but I made a note of it. Then
about four years later, during my mythological
studies, I came upon a book by the late Albrecht
Dieterich,3 the well-known philologist, which
threw light on this fantasy. The work, published in
1910, deals with a Greek papyrus in the
Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. Dieterich believed he
had discovered a Mithraic ritual in one part of the
text. The text is undoubtedly a religious prescrip-
tion for carrying out certain incantations in which
Mithras is named. It comes from the Alexandrian
school of mysticism and shows affinities with
certain passages in the Leiden papyri and the
Corpus Hermeticum. In Dieterich’s text we read the
following directions:

Draw breath from the rays, draw in three
times as strongly as you can and you will feel
yourself raised up and walking towards the
height, and you will seem to be in the middle
of the aerial region. . . . The path of the visible
gods will appear through the disc of the sun,
who is God my father. Likewise the so-called
tube, the origin of the ministering wind. For
you will see hanging down from the disc of
the sun something that looks like a tube. And
towards the regions westward it is as though
there were an infinite east wind. But if the
other wind should prevail towards the regions
of the east, you will in like manner see the
vision veering in that directions.4

104

Understanding Dreams

It is obviously the author’s intention to enable

the reader to experience the vision which he had,
or which at least he believes in. The reader is to be
initiated into the inner religious experience either of
the author, or—what seems more likely—of one
of those mystic communities of which Philo
Judaeus gives contemporary accounts. The fire- or
sun-god here invoked is a figure which has close
historical parallels, for instance with the Christ-
figure of the Apocalypse. It is therefore a
“representation collective,” as are also the ritual
actions described, such as the imitating of animal
noises, etc. The vision is embedded in a religious
context of a distinctly ecstatic nature and describes
a kind of initiation into mystic experience of the
Deity.

Our patient was about ten years older than I.

In his megalomania, he thought he was God and
Christ in one person. His attitude towards me was
patronizing; he liked me probably because I was
the only person with any sympathy for his abstruse
ideas. His delusions were mainly religious, and
when he invited me to blink into the sun like he
did and waggle my head he obviously wanted to
let me share his vision. He played the role of the
mystic sage and I was the neophyte. He felt he was
the sun-god himself, creating the wind by wagging
his head to and fro. The ritual transformation into
the Deity is attested by Apuleius in the Isis myster-
ies, and moreover in the form of  a Helios apo-
theosis. The meaning of  the “ministering wind” is
probably the same as the procreative pneuma,
which streams from the sun-god into the soul and
fructifies it. The association of sun and wind
frequently occurs in ancient symbolism.

It must now be shown that this is not a
purely chance coincidence of  two isolated cases.
We must therefore show that the idea of  a wind-
tube connected with God or the sun exists inde-
pendently of these two testimonies and that it
occurs at other times and in other places. Now
there are, as a matter of fact, medieval paintings
that depict the fructification of Mary with a tube
or hose-pipe coming down from the throne of
God and passing into her body, and we can see
the dove or the Christ-child flying down it. The
dove represents the fructifying agent, the wind of
the Holy Ghost.

Now it is quite out of the question that the

patient could have had any knowledge whatever
of a Greek papyrus published four years later, and
it is in the highest degree unlikely that his vision had
anything to do with the rare medieval representa-
tions of the Conception, even if through some
incredibly improbable chance he had ever seen a
copy of  such a painting. The patient was certified
in his early twenties. He had never traveled. And
there is no such picture in the public art gallery in
Zurich, his native town.

I mention this case not in order to prove that
the vision is an archetype but only to show you my
method of procedure in the simplest possible
form. If  we had only such cases, the task of
investigation would be relatively easy, but in reality
the proof is much more complicated. First of all,
certain symbols have to be isolated clearly enough
to be recognizable as typical phenomena, not just
matters of chance. This is done by examining a
series of dreams, say a few hundred, for typical
figures, and by observing their development in the
series. The same method can be applied to the
products of active imagination. In this way it is
possible to establish certain continuities or modula-
tions of  one and the same figure. You can select
any figure which gives the impression of being an
archetype by its behaviour in the series of dreams
or visions. If  the material at one’s disposal has been
well observed and is sufficiently ample, one can
discover interesting facts about the variations
undergone by a single type. Not only the type itself
but its variants too can be substantiated by evi-
dence from comparative mythology and ethnol-
ogy. I have described the method of  investigation
elsewhere5 and have also furnished the necessary
case material.
